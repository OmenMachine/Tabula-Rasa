## CC
so the point of this section is going to be to get a player to have a completed character sheet as fast as possible with a minimal understanding of the elements involved. for that we don't really need to describe flavor, skills, etc. maybe attributes if we are including them
### character points OR standard array+7/-3 flavor
#### essence and essence stats
### blood in the sand style CC
### tabula specific CC (players make own skills)
### flavor (a minimal definition of and how to stick it on your sheet)
#### equipment (i think this is just flavor in the new system)

## character progression (leveling up)
### elder scrolls leveling

## skills
### stock skills (these should come with the setting)
### limiting factors (to PC-made skills)
