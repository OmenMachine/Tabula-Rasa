ST TIPS
	recap
	fairness. dtms checks.
	yes, and... think of how 'it' can work. you arent against the players
	keep it rolling. 1m turns. scene change when stalled. make calls. dont argue with the ST.
	make sure you are telling a story that includes all of your players
	beginning, middle, and end
	relevant scenes (petitioner & granter, walking isnt gameplay>>fast foreward)
	what are my thoughts on down time?
	NPC's (creation, skills, flavor, items, loot, leveling, grouping...)
	handling power mismatch (dragons, lightsabers, groups, and the flash)
	avoid paralyzing players with misinformaton or fear
	no repeats
	dont start immediately
	no phones
	no wandering. pay attention.
	absent players
	dont split the party.
	do planning. make a map.
RP TIPS
	if youre bored with your character try to acquire more power.
	heroes do dumb shit. dont be paralysed by fear. its a game. dying is fine.
	glory or death
	be curious about things. take the scenic route. the direct aproach rarely works.
	interact with people and things. even if its rude.
	dont interrupt the st
	dont argue with the st
	just roll the dice
