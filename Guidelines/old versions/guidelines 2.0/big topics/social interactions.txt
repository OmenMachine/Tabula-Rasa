Anything that primarily influences another character's throughts counts as a social interaction.
Some forms of magic, like hypnotisim, illusion, or mind control, fall under this umbrella.
Some items, like love potions or invisibility cloaks also fall under this umbrella.

When a character rolls a check for a social skill one of four things happens.
They can fail.
They can succeed and the other party is affected.
They can succeed and the other party rolls to resist.
They can succeed and the other party is unaffected.

Only use the last two options if there is a good reason for the other party to be able to resist or completely immune.
Players can use the third and fourth options if they give the storyteller a good reason.
