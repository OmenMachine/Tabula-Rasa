To give a bonus on a skill check only make the character roll 2d6 instead of 3d6.
If you want to penalize a skill check make the character roll 4d6 instead of 3d6.

When a player tries to use a skill to do something it could plausibly do it is often better to make them take a new skill.
Have the new skill start at half the level of the skill they were trying to use.
For example "melee with spears level 7" would turn into "melee with axes level 3" if the character lost their spear but has an axe.

In combat you can give bonuses and penalties to initiative or damage dice.
