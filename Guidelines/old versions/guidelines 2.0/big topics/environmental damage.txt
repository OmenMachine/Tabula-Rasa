Any damage dealt by inanimate objects like dart traps or falling rocks counts as environmental damage.

Environmental damage usually consists of an item, a couple d6, and the trapmaker's skill level if it is a trap.
For example a (sleep dart:3 + trap skill:6 + 1d6) might deal 10-15 damage before armor and put the player to sleep.
See the "items" section in "core" for how to make items.
The skill of the trap-maker can be made in the same way if necessary.
Any number of dice can be added to the environmental damage dice pool.

To roll accuracy for a trap it is skill+item vs 3d6.
The accuracy for non-trap environmental damage is naturally lower at item vs 3d6.
Some traps can be dodged once it is determined they will hit.
See the "high-stress situations" section for the dodging and blocking mechanics.

Some environmental damage is unavoidable and as such always hits.
If a player thinks of something clever let them try to dodge it though.
