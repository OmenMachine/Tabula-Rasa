I have tried to design this section such that transitionaing between chases, combats, and stealth is fluid.
The guidelines in this section are for all three.

A chase should have rough distances between characters.
A good unit of distance is "one mvoe action" in my experience.
A character cant chase more than one group of other character's at one.

A combat just needs characters who wish to do each other harm.

Scenes involving stealth just need to be described well.
It is perfectly acceptable to "wait for your moment" to join combat if youre stealthed.
