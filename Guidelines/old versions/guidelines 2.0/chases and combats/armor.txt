Armor items decrease a chracter's maximum SP and increase their ARM stat.
The values from armor items stack.
Whether or not this works for character's wearing 2 helmets is your business.

For example:
A character has a level 3 helmet, a level 7 chestplate, 4 DEX, 2 STR, and 9 END.
ARM = 7 + 3 = 10.
SP = 4 + 2 + 9 - 10 = 5.
