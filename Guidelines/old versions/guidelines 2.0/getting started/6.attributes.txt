Attributes are the numbers representing how good a character is at a type of task.
Attributes do not level up but the storyteller can increase or decrese them throughout the story.
Base attribues range from 0 to 9.

There are seven base attributes.
They are STR(strength), DEX(dexterity), END(endurance), CHA(charisma), PER(perception), INT(intillect), and WIL(willpower).
STR is obvious.
DEX is a character's speed and cordination.
END is how slowly the character tires.
CHA is a character's ability to communicate.
PER is a character's sensory ability.
INT is how fast a character learns.
WIL is the certainty a character posesses.

There are five derived attributes.
They are HP(health points), MP(mana points), SP(stamina points), ARM(total armor), and INI(initiative).
HP, MP, and SP all have maximum values and current values.
A character's maximum hit point value is [HP = STR + END + WIL].
A character's maximum mana point value is the sum of the attributes the storyteller chooses to contribute to it.
A character's maxumum stamina point value is [SP = STR + END + DEX - ARM].
Armor is the sum of the levels of the armor items the character is wearing.
Initiative bonus is [INI = (DEX + PER) / 2].
A character's current HP regenerates one point when they sleep.
A character's current MP refills when they sleep.
A character's current SP refills when not in a chase or combat.
