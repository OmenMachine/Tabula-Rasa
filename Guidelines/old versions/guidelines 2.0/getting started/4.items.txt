Items are just imaginary physical objects with numbers attached to signify value or quality.

To make a new random item roll 3d6/2 and round down.
Add a noun and maybe some adjectives to the item.
The only difference between two "level 5 sword"s is their descriptions.

To determine your story's item level to currency ratio decide how much a level 9 item is worth.
Then to determine the price of any item divide it by 10 once for each level below 9 it is.
For example if a level 9 item is worth $1,000,000 then a level 5 item is worth $100.

Items can be crafted or upgraded with the appropriate skills, materials, and tools.

Armor items stack but so does their SP penalty.
See "armor" in "chases and combats".

A weapon item's value is added to damage for attacks that use it.
See "damage" in "chases and combats".

Items like night-vision goggles can grant new abilities to a character.

Some items never have their level used in a calculation or roll.
These items are intangibly valuble and the story should reflect this.
For example a single crappy lock-pick might break after a failed check.
An expensive kit with multiple different picks might justify another try.
