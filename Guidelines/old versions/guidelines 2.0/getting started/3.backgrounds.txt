Backgrounds are the things a character is or has. 
Backgrounds can be physical, magical, social, mental, material, etc.
Unique racial traits, good luck, friends in high places, photographic memory, and owning a castle all qualify.
Backgrounds are role-playing flavor, not stat boosts, so they should never have numbers or dice associated with them.
When possible, backgrounds should have some of a character's personal history associated with them.

Characters can be born with or acquire backgrounds.
Players get several backgrounds at character creation and can earn more during the story.

The storyteller should list backgrounds that would constitute as the norm in their story.
A character's backgrounds illustrate how they are different from the story norm.
