Skills are words or short phrases describing the things a character can do.
Some things like "breathing under water" can be either a skill or background.
If there is a chance you will fail such as for a water-breathing spell it is a skill.
Having gills would be a background.

Skills range in level from 0 to 9.
Players get several skills at character creation.
Skills can be learned, created, or inherited.
Skills learned during the story start at level 1 or half the level of a related skill.

Players make their own skills.
This usually happens at character creation but more can be made or aquired throughout the story.
Work with players while they are making their skills so you can stop them from taking skills like "god powers".
If you aren't sure if a skill is going to be a problem attach a limit to it so it is easier to deal with.
Remind players to take "common language" and "spot check" so they can talk to each other and see things.

A skill check needs to be rolled if a character's ability to do something is in question.
Simple tasks like walking down stairs do not qualify unless the character is very drunk.
First, declare what the character is trying to do.
Then, they pick an appropriate attribute and roll 3d6.
If the sum of the skill+attribute is less than or equal to the sum of the 3d6 the action succeeds.
If the dice are higher the action fails.

When a check is rolled keep track of whether the skill succeeded or failed.
If you have either, higher INT or a related skill of higher level mark 2 successes or failures instead.
If you have both, higher INT and a related skill of higher level mark 3 successes or failures instead.
When the skill accumulates successes and failures equal to the level of the skill it levels up.
Clear accumulated successes and failures when this happens.
