Contests as checks
This is where more than two characters all/both roll to see who accomplishes the same task best. The most common example is a race. It is also the most frequent time to use magnitude of failure. (in a hypothetical battle between tons of NPC’s that cannot be resolved in one turn, but where progress must be visible to players magnitude of failure can describe troop loss in a more reasonably manner than magnitude of success). In any event the process is that each character/group assembles a dice pool without a difficulty rating (negative d10’s) and rolls it. The successes each character/group gets are compared and so are the net good/bad-stuffs. These can then be used to resolve things in the game. either don’t break ties or find your own way to do it.
I DONT UNDERSTNAD THIS SECTION WELL ENOUGH TO SYNTHESIZE IT


Okay so here’s the deal. The DM is there to empower the players’ characters. This means that the end of your villains’ story arcs is to die, the end of your barmaids’ arcs is to get ploughed, and the goal for any treasure you put in the world it to be found and used if possible and sold otherwise.
Your first thought when your players want to do something is “how can I make this work?” rather than “well, here is a reason that doesn’t work.” You aren’t against the players. You aren’t trying to kill them. You are god and you are supposed to make them the heroes (or villains) of the land. You most certainly are not trying to kill them. You aren’t their enemy even though you wear their skins.
Making the game
Pick your setting and describe it to your players.
If you want a say in the matter tell your players what kind of group they have to be or what they have to choose from.
Tell them how much starting experience they get for their players.
Help each player come up with reasonable starting gear and skills for your setting.
How to make a story concise (this is a good thing)
If you don’t know why short stories are better than long ones, go ask someone—google perhaps. I’m not devoting the room to telling you.
In any event they are and a good way to make them shorter is to plan out episodes in a flowchart like roadmap. The entire flowchart is your entire story. Each node should be one session and should be completable in exactly one session. Shoot for this. Modify the chart and your storytelling style as necessary to make it fit. After it fits if you have a flowchart that cant fit on a single piece of paper when written in sharpie your story is probably too bit and your group might fall apart. You have been warned. Make short campaigns, and arcs.
Don’t roll to put on pants
Don’t make or let players roll for every little thing and certainly don’t do it yourself. This slows the game down and its awful. A check should be reasonably likely to fail or the magnitude of success should matter if you’re going to roll it at all.
Information distribution
So, there are 3 ways players get information in the story. The first is the information you give to them. this should never be denied them. if you want your players to have some info give it to them. don’t think you have to make them roll for everything.
The second is the meta-information the players get while playing with you. If you a simple example is that if you lie to them about the seriousness of the dangers you present them with they will stop taking your dangers seriously.
The third is the grease that keeps the story moving when the players get stuck. When players get stuck and don’t know what to do they are almost always either paralyzed by fear or ignorance. If it’s the latter they will roll/should roll to gather more information with history, arcana, science, etc. checks and then you can throw them a hint.
Dealing with cowardice
If your players are averse to combat you have a few options. One, give them a way to progress that does not involve combat. Two, arm them better be it with weapons or knowledge. Thirdly, its tricky to do right, but you can bring the danger to your players. Just remember that the only characters that play like half-orc berserkers are half-orc berserkers.
Don’t make your NPC’s overly powerful
It can be tempting to make characters that are as gods walking among the player characters but the uniform reaction to characters like these is to run from them or ignore them. This is because the players cannot interact with them favorably.
Group NPC’s during combat
All the NPCs already go on my turn you say. How can I group them more than that? Take all the NPC’s of the same type. Have them all act as one unit. Give them joint attacks and such. Give them a shared life pool if they have hitpoints.
How to make NPCs quickly
Its very simple. Don’t spend all their experience.
Give them the skills they will need immediately (don’t make them too powerful) and whenever they need a new skill write it down and allocate points to it. The default skills are attack, defend, move, hide, see, lie, detect lies, persuade, and resist persuasion if you’re going for a complete template. Here are some templates for 20exp NPCs:

remaingin exp:	5

Recap the last session at the beginning of each session
A recap is a good way to get things started because it reminds characters where they were at the end of the last session. Either the players or the DM can do the recap. Personally I think the DM doing it works better but either will do so long as it happens.
Don’t use a BLANK twice
I am thinking of this mostly with respect to random encounter tables. If they are used enough that the same encounter comes more than once it is time to move on. Make a new table; Reskin them; Do anything other than look lazy because your players will become detached very quickly. That example out of the way this goes for loot table, procedurally generated maps, character names, etc. Beware of random generators.
Make sure something can happen in each scene
Make sure than in every scene one character wants something from some other character in that scene. This is something I stole from blood on the snow. The concept is that there is a granter and a petitioner. The petitioner wants something the granter has and the scene is about their interactions. It doesn’t even have to be transferred successfully. The scene just needs to center around these two.
Adapt your not only your story but your game as well
Most times the players in your game will like different types of thing. One might like method acting (roleplaying), another might like solving puzzles, and another might like breaking out the figurines and bashing some skulls.
The point is you need to make sure there is something in not just your story but your game for all of your players. If one is sitting there dejected, never doing anything ask him what he liked doing most previously and toss some of that his way.
Forgo giving explanation
Imagine this. Your running a campaign with 7 people. two of them chosen at random are absent every week. If you insist on giving explanation for their odd appearances and disappearances in the story that is what the story will be about. In situations like that it is better to just add and remove characters from scenes as needed without explaining it.
Make a list of names and cross them out as you use them
Make a list of 10 female and 10 male names that are appropriate for the setting. 10 last names even if youre feeling up to it. As you use them cross them off your list. This does a couple things. First it helps maintain an even population ratio. Second it keeps you from reusing. Third, last, and most important it lets you rattle off the name of any NPC the players encounter.
Steal ideas from your players
When your players talk about stuff while making plans they often discuss plot elements out of character. Steal it and put it in your game. it is a easy way to give your players the feeling of bias confirmation.
Use common sense in your rulings
There are no rules for many things in this system. Imagine the scenario vividly, draw it if you have to. Think about whether something is plausible or cool. If it either rule in the players favor. Actually just err in their favor unless you have a compelling reason not to. (“no you cannot punch the moon into the earth”)
Plan out your sessions a bit
Making a map is a damn good place to start. Making the local government is a good second step. Import locations is a third. NPC’s in those locations. Etc. etc. This helps immensely if you have the time for it.
End combats early
Take this situation for example. The players have just hacked their way through an hour long boss fight. They have killed the boss. Unfortunately someone needs to clean up his peons. They can do it but it will take a while because there are so many of them. It may seem inelegant but once a battle becomes a foregone conclusion it becomes a waste of everyone’s time to play it out. Just end the damn thing. Roll one more time, have the players kill all the badguys, deal with any good/bad-stuff and maybe have the players take damage based on the magnitude of failure if any or even the magnitude of badstuff.
