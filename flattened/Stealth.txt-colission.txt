Stealth is where a character hides themselves from other characters. This can be accomplished with magic as well as cunning.
Full stealth is where no one knows where a character is except that character’s allies. Entering a chase or combat from full stealth grants 10 bonus initiative.
Partial stealth is being hidden relative to some characters but visible to others. Entering a chase or combat from partial stealth grants 5 bonus initiative.
Attempting to enter stealth from a chase or combat costs an action, a stealth check, and somewhere to hide.
To stay hidden whilst doing something that could potentially reveal his or her location a character should roll additional stealth checks.
