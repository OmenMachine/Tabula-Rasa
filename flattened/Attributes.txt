Attributes are the numbers representing how good a character is at a type of task. Attributes do not level up but the storyteller can increase or decrease them throughout the story.
There are seven base attributes and they range in level from 1 to 9. The base attributes are STR(Strength), DEX(dexterity), END(endurance), CHA(charisma), PER(perception), INT(intellect), and WIL(willpower).
There are five derived attributes. They are INI(base initiative), ARM(total armor), HP(health points), SP(stamina points), and MP(mana points).
INI = (DEX + PER) / 2
ARM = sum of worn armor-item levels—see the Items section.
HP = STR + END + WIL
SP = STR + DEX + END – ARM
MP = the sum of two attributes chosen by the storyteller—see the Magic section.
