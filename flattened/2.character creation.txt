Players should start by thinking of their character's concept.
Once they have a clear mental image and can describe their character, proceed.

Choose a few backgrounds for the characer.
Characters should have roughly the same number of "good" and "bad" backgrounds.
A background is "bad" if you don't want it on your character sheet.
See the "backgrounds" section. 

Distribute 40 points into the character's base attributes.
Afterwards calculate the derived attributes.
See the "attributes" section.

Make 10-15 skills for the character.
Distribute 55 points into the character's skills.
See the "skills" section.

Lastly, choose how much money each charcter should start with and let them purchase gear.
See the "items" section.
