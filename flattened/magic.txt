The storyteller decides what attributes are used for magic checks and maximum mana points.
The story teller also decides which 2 of skill, attribute, and item are used for damage.
Here are some examples of how to do this.

Say for example the storyteller decides magic is performed by channeling spirits to do your will.
Mana might be [CHA + PER] because you need to be able to see and communicate with spirits.
Doing magic might look like spirit-magic[CHA] vs 3d6 because you need to convince the spirit.
Dealing damage might be [WIL + spirit magic + 1d6] becasue the better anchored in the world the spirit is the more it can do.

In a setting where magic is extremely unnatural it might look like this.
MP = WIL + END. (this is mentally and physically taxing)
Check = telekinesis[WIL] vs 3d6. (mentally taxing)
Damage = [WIL + item + 1d6] where the item is a rock or a sword or something. (mentally taxing)

Maybe magic is more formulaic and all the caster does is activate it.
MP = nothing or based on an item because the magic isnt coming from you.
Check = wand waving[INT] vs 3d6. (just gotta know how to do it)
Damage = [item + wand waving + 1d6]. (once agian not based on you. just your skill and materials)
