Start by thinking of the character's concept. Once you can picture and describe the character proceed with the other steps in any order.
Choose a couple backgrounds—see the Backgrounds section—for the character. Characters should have roughly the same number of “good” and “bad” backgrounds. A bad background is something you don’t want on your character sheet.
Make skills for the character—see the Skills section—and get them “okayed” by the storyteller. Then distribute 60 points into these skills. Each skill must have a minimum of 1 point put into it.
The storyteller determines how much money each character should start with. Use this money to make and purchase items—see the Items section—for the character.
Distribute 40 points into the character’s base attributes. Each attribute must have a minimum of 1 point put into it. Calculate derived attributes from the character’s base attributes.
