This is a Role-playing system written by Harley Dutton and tested by Nathaniel Bernheim.
This system works well for novice role-players but a storyteller running it should have experience and foresight. Required materials are six-sided dice, paper, and pencils. Setup and character creation should take less than an hour.
This system can accommodate any character or setting. There are no canonical species, lore, settings, or special powers. Your group must create its own or use that of its favorite fictional world.
It should be noted that sometimes the guidelines don’t really work. Add to, modify, or ignore them when this happens.
It is intended that social interactions involve more real-life conversation than die-rolling.
Stealth scenes, chases, and combats all use the same guidelines so that switching between them is fluid.
