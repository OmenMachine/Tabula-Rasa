Items are just objects with numbers and descriptions attached to signify value and or quality.
To make a new random item roll 3 dice, add them, and divide by 2 rounded down [3d6/2]. Add a noun and maybe a couple adjectives to the item and its done. The only difference between two “level 5 sword”s is their descriptions. Items can range in level from 1 to 9.
To determine how much items are worth the story teller should decide how much a level 9 item costs. Then for every level the item is lower than 9 divide that price by 10 once. For example, if a level 9 luxury sports car costs $1,000,00 then a normal level 5 car is worth $1,000.
Items can be crafted and upgraded with the appropriate skills, materials, and tools.
Armor items stack—see the Armor section—to give more ARM. It’s up to the storyteller whether this works for wearing 2 helmets or 15 level 1 burlap sack shirts.
A weapon’s item value is added to the damage roll—see the Damage section—for any attacks that use it. Items have no bearing on how likely an attack is to hit.
Items like night-vision goggles can grant new abilities to a character. Some items may require characters to roll a check to use them.
Some items never have their level used in a calculation or roll. The story should still reflect their value. For example, a single crappy lock pick made from a hairpin might break after a single failed attempt on a lock while an expensive lock picking kit might have multiple tools justifying a second try with a different tool after failing once.
