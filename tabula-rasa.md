#Tabula Rasa
##Intro
##Definitions
Storyteller = DM (Dungeon Master)
##Required Materials
Character sheets, pencils/pens, and three six-sided dice. A map of the world, a battle-grid, and character models might help as well.
##Character Creation
Players should ask the Storyteller 
at one point i was strongly in favor of group character creation where the other players could modify your character in minor ways
###Attributes
it might be worthwhile to split stats into physical, mental, social, and magical. Of these mental is the most generically useless in a role-playing situation.
###Skills
All characters should have the ability to attack, defend, move, hide, see, lie, detect lies, persuade, resist persuasion and much more.
Skills are all made up and characters should be able to do each of these things with their skills. probably more things too
##skill checks
At some point i though about a magnitude of success table. I don't remember what it was based on.
At some point i thought it was  a good idea to have flavor. i think this gave bonuses/detriments on rolls.
###star wars check system
at some point i liked the star wars RPG system of dice having successes and "good stuff" on them and failures and "bad stuff". this led to a system where you could have phyrric victories and defeats that weren't all bad.
Decide whether or not i want crit successes and/or crit failures.
possibly put crits and crit fails on a separate die to control the probability of such.
buy successes/failures and good/bad stuff with pips on the relevant dice.
should rolls always be opposed?
at some point i was in favor of constructing skill checks based on positive and negative dice. negative dice represented the difficulty of the task and the difficulties resulting from the situation. positive dice would represent the character's skill at the task and any advantages they had towards completing the task. when all the positive and negative dice are rolled successes cancel failures and negatives cancel failures.
very good/bad stuff always overrides the other good/bad in the typical opposed roll.
a check fails if there are fewer successes than failures on the dice. it seems like this system expects you to purchase successes, failures, good stuff, and bad stuff. it also seems like it requires far more than three identical 6ds. it seems like it wants d10s and specfic symbols on those dice.
excess successes and failures contribute to magnitude of success.
excess good stuff and bad stuff mean nothing in particular.
net good/bad stuff means a bunch of good/bad story things happen. this might be a little insane if it happens to often. the DM only has to resolve one good/bad stuff per check
##Combat
It looks like i was favoring shadowrun style initiative/speed in the past
disallowing called shots in favor of the doubles -> dragon dice method from dragon age seems really good. shadowrun style initiative is where characters roll initiative and get a score, and then combat goes in rounds. Each round subtracts some number (10 in shadowrun) from each intiative and each character that still has a non-negative initiative score gets a turn.
###action economy
this is actually a pretty good idea. figure out how to implement it and classify actions in this game. major, minor, full, free, reaction etc. (mental, channeled) can players get additional actions? how?
###grouping NPCS
provide some simple method of grouping NPCs in combat
###Armor
Armor should subtract from damage dealt
###Dodge
Dodge should be the opposition to to-hit rolls.
###Damage, Wounds, and Death
In the current moment i vote for either perma-death or no relevant hitpoints.
##Stealth
At some point I though spot checks were unnecessary. AT THE ITME i was fine with players rolling spot checks for info anyway if they were stuck in a roleplaying situation.
##experience and leveling up and new skills and flavor
get 1-2 exp per session/in-game night.
spend an experience to get the first level in a made-up skill (all skills are made up) but you may have to role-play the acquisition.
i guess you have to rolaply for new "flavor".
##Contests as checks
this looks like it is still using the starwars style checks. all parties roll and magnitude of successes are what matters for eliminating contestants and magnitude of success could determine winners. good and bad stuff could apply to whomever rolled them respectively.
###default skills
attack, defend, hide, observe, lie, detect lies, persuade, resist persuasion
##blood in the sand style character creation
make a character concept. all the other players at the table do the same. then one by one each player at the table adds a bond between two characters until the character graph is mostly linked.
##tabula specific character creation
the main point of this system is to let players create skills. that shit gets fucking wild fast. i will need to revise this later but perhaps each character gets to create ONE skill for their character. the DM should review each skill before character creation. the DM is allowed to put restrictions on your skills if they are too OP/too much of a pain in the ass/not fun for the other people at the table.
###flavor
IIRC flavor was short descriptive words or phrases that would give +1 or -1 in situations in which they applied. Ciazio stacked "strong" worded a few different ways and had a +4. balance this.
##equipment
i think tabula lets players make their own gear too?
##storytelling
###creating a story
provide some kind of visual framework like a flowchart for creating episodic stories. scenes should have a few options as to how they can resolve most times.
an alternative method of creating the story is how blood in the snow does it. make sure each scene has a granter and a petitioner. (petitioner wants _something_ from granter). the scene can resolve however it does but it should start with these two elements. I think both were supposed to be PCs. i think the players and possibly the game "referee" are supposed to come up with scenes like this on the fly. this is from blood in the snow.
###creating NPCs
same as PCs but don't spend ALL of their exp immediately. allow them to fudge the numbers and gain skills as needed. maybe create their special skill if they have one immediately.
###tables
provide tables that are blank but easy to fill in for _interesting_ random encounters, loot, traps, stores, etc. provide a fillable DM screen too. provide a fillable character sheet too
###worldbuilding and creating maps
###skill checks
a check should probably involve dice, maybe equipment, a base stat, a specialization stat, perhaps another specialization stat, and situational modifiers.
##leveling up
at one point i was in love with the idea that leveling up a skill was done by using it. this would mean you have to accumulate successes, failures, or both equal to something (the skills level) to level it up
I also liked the idea of having traditional floating experience level up skills at some rate. it was also nice being able to transition smoothly from character creation to playing the game with VTM esque bonus points being the same as exp
### called shots and stunt points
exalted, D&D, and Dragon Age: the RPG all had different ways to deal with this. All had their own merits. In D&D you said what you wanted to do ahead of time and it modified the difficulty of the roll. If you were successful it happened. full stop. This involved many tables of modifiers usually and it was a slow process. The Star Wars RPG mitigated this issue by boiling every modifier to a die that got added to the check's pool. It kinda sucked when your checks didn't pass but it was always worded as "I try to" not "I do"
In Dragon Age you rolled the check and then if you got stunt points (based on 2/3 dice matching faces) you got the number of stunt points on the "dragon die" (the first one). This made things go faster but limited options.
Exalted was odd. You actually got "style points" for calling your describing your actions in detail. This resulted in most shots being called shots and having to ret-con cool descriptions when the check didn't pass.
##attributes
this should probably go under character creation or skill checks if anything
dex,str,stam,perception,luck,cha,wit,int,resolve
what are the attributes good for? Dodge[dex] only useable at dm discretion. Should be roleplayed. Stealth[dex] Firearms[dex] archery[dex] Swordfighting[dex] or any other melee weapon Intimidation[str/cha] Lying[wit] Read[int] Write[int] lockpicking[dex] Gamble[luc] Pickpocketing[dex] Lying[cha/wit] Cooking Detect magic[per] Investigate[per] Lore of ____[int] choose a culture/race Seduce[cha] Tracking[per] Convince[cha] Fishing[int] Catching fish[dex] Wound care[int] Camping[int] Horse riding[dex] sailing[int/dex] Lifting[str] jumping/acrobatics/Running/dodge[dex] ploughing/lifting/sex[str/sta] smithing/fletching/carpentry/other [dex/int] Barter[cha] Use eyes/awareness/spot check/see the thing[per] see/sense magic stuff[per] empathy/understand person[per] unarmed combat[dex] block[stam] dodge[dex]
I think rather than having a list of this shit i should just make each of the attributes fairly self explanatory and make it so if you want to use a skill you make a case for what attribute you use to make it happen.
