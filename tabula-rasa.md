# Tabula Rasa (Introduction)

Tabula Rasa is a worldbuilding framework and a rules-light, generic roleplaying game that lets players create their own skills.

The worldbuilding framework produces a Setting. Settings are short, standardized, and easily sharable descriptions of a single place within a world. The intent is that Settings can be used to quickly understand a part of the world such that a player can create a Character or the Storyteller can create an Adventure.

The roleplaying system is generic so it will work with any Setting produced by the worldbuilding framework. The rules are minimal meaning you and your group should be able to create any character imaginable within the setting and start playing very quickly!

# Character Creation
Characters need skills, flavor and an action delay to be playable. The first thing a player should do when making a character is take a look at the [setting](#setting), read through it and make sure they understand the world. Players can propose things be added to the setting because they are supposed to have a mild influence upon what exists within the setting.

First fill out the top of your character sheet. In order, the boxes should contain the character's name, the character's concept, the setting's name, your name, and the setting's action delay. A character concept can be thought of as the canonical or stereotypical version of something. The setting's action delay can be found in the upper left corner of the setting template.

Second, your character needs [skills](#skills). Skills are used to roll checks which is how a character interacts with the game world. Skills are usually self-descriptively named and have levels. The higher level the skill the better at it a character is.
There are two kinds of skills. Mandatory skills and the normal kind. Mandatory skills are skills every character _needs_ within the setting. They are listed at the top of the skills section in the setting. Add all of the mandatory skills to your character sheet. The rest of the skills are those that are common within the setting and you can take any of them you can afford. Players can also propose to the storyteller that skills be added to the setting. You pay for your starting skills using character points. Starting character points are listed in the upper left of the setting. Skills cost a number of character points equal to the level you want the skill to start at. An important note about skills is that players are enocuraged to add new skills to the list of available skills in the setting. Storyteller approval is required for a skill to to be added to the setting.

```
Example mandatory skills: willpower, strength, magic, dexterity, charisma
Example skills: sword fighting, pyromancy, computer hacking, seduction
```

Third, your character needs [flavor](#flavor). Flavor is a word or short phrase describing a character. It can include knowledge, possessions, physique, and even social position. Review the starting flavor options listed on the setting. This will almost always give your character a language, clothes, and equipment relevant for the setting. When the setting specifies a type of flavor but not what it is specifically you get to choose something that would fit within the setting. Add your choice of starting flavor to your character sheet. Afterward, add flavor to your character to describe them. Flavor costs one character point per after you have your starting flavor. Flavor is usually just that, flavor, but occasionally it can make checks easier or harder.

# How to Play
Tabula Rasa is a roleplaying game. Experienced roleplayers can now proceed to the [Checks](#checks) section. For everyone else, roleplaying is a form of collaborative, improvizational storytelling.

One person, the storyteller, will present a world and a story. The storyteller can use a world, or setting, of their own design or one from popular media. The [setting](#setting) section has more details on what you can expect from this ficticious world. The storyteller is also responsible for giving the world life. They plan out scenes between players and NPCs, provide the decisions and voice acting for NPCs, and narrate events in the world to drive the story they have planned.

The rest of the people in a roleplaying game are players. Usually, players will create a character for the game. See the [character_creation](#character-creation) section for help with this. Once a player has a character, they will provide voice acting, motivations, and personality for the character in addition to controlling their actions within the fictious realm of the story.

A night of roleplaying usually lasts anywhere from two to six hours and usually includes a variety of scenes. Exhilirating chases, nail-biteing espionage, terrifying battles, grand speeches, descriptions of exotic lands, and of course joking around in and out of character are all hallmarks of good roleplaying.

Most good stories include conflict. This will usually end up being between the the player-characters and either NPCs or some other element in the story. When a conflict arises, resolve it by rolling a skill-check. Please see the [checks](#checks) section for help with this.

# Checks
When conflict occurs during roleplaying the fairest way to resolve it most times is by rolling a skill-check. A skill-check is where one of a character's skills is tested against some number of dice which represent the difficulty of the task. If the character's skill is greater than or equal to the sum of the dice then the character passes the skill-check. Usually this will also mean that whatever the character was attmepting to accomplish succeeds. If the dice are greater than the character's skill level the action fails and something bad might happen. The number of dice depends on the difficulty of the task. Flavor can influence difficulty.

## Difficulty
The difficulty of a skill check can be modified by a number of things. A character's flavor, other characters, and the world itself can all cause a skill-check to become easier or harder. The storyteller decides if any of these things is meaningful enough to make the roll easy or hard.
| subjective difficulty | dice representation  |
| --------------------- | -------------------- |
| easy                  | pass if skill >= 1d6 |
| normal                | pass if skill >= 2d6 |
| hard                  | pass if skill >= 3d6 |
| harder                | pass if skill >= 4d6 |
| etc.                  | pass if skill >= 5d6 |

## Nested Checks
If a character is trying to do two things at once, juggling while doing a backflip for instance, just increase the difficulty. If a player is doing two things that are radically different, that is the apropriate time to make two skill checks. (Doing a backflip and casting a spell)

## Progression
To level up a skill you need to pass skill checks with it. Whenever you pass a skill-check with a skill add one to that skill's experience. When the skill's experience is equal to it's level it levels up and the experience resets to zero. You can only level up a skill at level one by making the check easy.

## Event Die
The storyteller can introduce the event die whenever they want. Basically when a check is rolled an additional d6 is rolled. If this d6 comes up 1 something bad might happen and if it comes up 6 something good might happen. It is best to have an extra d6 of a different color if you are going to add the event die to every roll. The event die is a convenient way to handle crits and crit fails in this system.

## Gambits
Gambits are where you make a deal with the storyreller to modify the the difficulty of a check, the pass-effect, and the fail-effect. You might ask for something special to happen on a success in exchange for an increase in difficulty.

## Magnitude of Success
If you ever need a magnitude of success for a roll, like damage or crafting, just roll a single d6 and use this chart.

| Die result | Magnitude of success |
| :--------: | :------------------: |
|   6 pip    |         100%         |
|   5 pip    |         80%          |
|   4 pip    |         60%          |
|   3 pip    |         40%          |
|   2 pip    |         20%          |
|   1 pip    |          0%          |



## Example
<!-- this should be right after the description probably? -->
For example lets say John, the NPC character wants to do a backflip. The first thing John will do is look for a relevant skill on his character sheet. `Acrobatics`, `athletics`, `dexterity`, `phisique` or anything similar will work for this check. Lets say John has an `acrobatics` score of 11. Lets also say John has the flavor `leg wound` from a fight he got into recently. This would make the check hard, so john would be rolling 3d6 against his 11 in `acrobatics`. Lets say John gets a sum of 10 on the dice. This means John was able to successfully do a backflip despite his `leg wound`.

## Contests
For contests rather than just looking at whether or not a character succeeded look at the magnitude of success. Magnitude of success is how many successes were rolled on the contest check. The character with the most wins the contest.
Examples of contests include arm wrestling and racing. Characters can tie contests.

# Skills 
Each character has a list of skills representing the actions they can take in the story. Skills do have to be things that a character can *do* which also means they have to be able to fail as well. The setting will have a comprehensive list of skills available in the setting.
<!-- examples -->

## Mandatory Skills
All characters should have the ability to attack, defend, move, hide, see, lie, detect lies, persuade, resist persuasion, etc. The list of mandatory skills on the setting should represent these potential actions. All characters must have all mandatory skills for their setting. Mandatory skills are typically for actions that a character doesn't have a more suitable common skill for. Alternatively they are for performing very basic actions that every character must be able to perform like `seeing` or feats of `strength`. 

## Common Skills
Common skills are those that can be found in a setting. Not every character has these skills but most characters should be able to learn them given the opportunity. There will be a list of common skills within the setting document that players can add to their characters. Additionally, players can propose skills be added to the list of common skills found within the setting.

## Acquisition
New skills can be obtained at character creation by taking them off the list of skills and paying one CP per level of the desired skill and all previous levels of the skill recursively. For instance a level 3 skill would cost 6: 1 point for the first level, 2 CP for the second, and 3 CP for the third level cumulatively. To obtain new skills in the story ask the storyteller if you can being learning the skill.

## Progression
Skills level up once they have been used a number of times equal to their level. For example, to level up a level 7 `sword-fighting` a player would need to succeed at 7 `sword-fighting` checks. This usually means this will require over 7 attempts because failures do not earn exp. Mark successes next to the skill on your character sheet. 

## Mandatory Skills
Mandatory skills are those that every character must take some levels in. This is meant to represent the skills that every character should naturally have access to like `seeing`, `strength`, and `persuasion`. Granted, there are some characters who will have flavor that renders these skills useless or remove them entirely. The flavors `blind` and `paralyzed` come to mind.

## Available Skills
Available skills are those that are present in the setting but that not everyone has. They can be rare or common like `surgery` and `driving` are in modern times. The point is that not *every* character has them but most characters are able to learn these skills. Some more modern-day exmaples are cooking, driving, computer programming, basketball, and surgery.

# Flavor
Flavor is a mechanic in Tabula used to describe the interesting parts of a character. Almost anything unique that a character *is* or *has* is likely to be flavor. Flavor is used primarily for DTMS (does this make sense) checks and modifying the difficulty on checks. A few examples of flavor might be `armor`, `horse`, `landed noble`, `flaming sword`, `elf`, `big and tall`, etc. for an elvish knight of the summer court. Each piece of flavor should be a short, evocative description.

## Acquisition
Flavor can be gotten in three ways. First, it can be asked for an paid for with CP at character creation. It typically costs 1 CP per word for flavor at character creation unless modified by a deal. Second, it can be earned and paid for during the story similarly to at character creation. The only difference is that the storyteller may make you spend time in character to earn the flavor you want. Thirdly, flavor might be given to or inflicted upon a character as a result of the story. Lands and title may be given to a peasant after he rescues the princess but he may have also taken some fire damage from the dragon guarding here and have a half-melted face now.

## Negative Flavor
Negative flavor is usually gotten in two ways. The first way is usually through deals. Rather than asking for a piece of flavor that does something good and something bad a player might ask for a piece of flavor that is mostly bad and ask to be compensated for it. In return for their character being blind a player might ask that their character be *paid* 3 or 4 CP rather than spending 1 for that piece of flavor.
The second way characters usually get negative flavor is from combat. When one character lops off another's hand with a sword that new `-1 hand` will need to be remembered unless that character ceases to matter. Flavor can handle arbitrary negative effects like wounds perfectly.

## Deals
At character creaton you may have noticed that there is no way to modify action delay. There is also no way to get any special racial abilities. There is also no way to become rich and famous. Etc. The point is you have to talk to the storyteller when you are creating your character, ask for the things you want, and represent them as flavor. Sometimes the things you want are OP as shit and the DM will want to keep your character in line by raising the cost above the normal for what you are asking for. Want to be super fast? Have -2 action delay by being a vampire (instand death by sunlight). Want to be big enough you can throw cars? Become a Treant for +3 action delay and a vulnerability to fire. Perhaps you can be a world famous boxer if you also have some gambling debts. The point is, talk to your DM and work it out. Sometimes it is appropriate to add a deal to the setting such that it is available to all players and NPCs.

## Items
Unlike most other roleplaying games which have extensive tables for equipment, in Tabula I have opted to represent equipment as flavor. This means that armor, weapons, tools, vehicles, and treasure should be represented as flavor. Typically equipment will modify the difficulty of checks with relevant skills sometimes reducing the difficulty from `impossible` and effectively granting a character new abilities.

### Crafting
In Tabula, crafting is just a skill check. Describe what you want and how you plan on using your crafting skill to get it, ask the DM what the difficulty is, and make the roll. If you succeed you get the desired item, likely with some narritive flair. If you fail you get nothing and any materials and time that went into the crafting are likely consumed.

## Money
In Tabula, money is represented even more abstractly than usual as flavor. Before we get into that lets talk about how money spends in roleplaying games. A simple breakdown of prices would be to say that things can be non-numerically priced as trivial, minor, major, priceless. The legality and availability of items will vary with the story. It is intended that minor and major purchases be acquired through roleplaying.

### Trivial Purchases
Trivial purchases are things like food, clothes, entertainment, ammunition, and gasoline that should typically be available to the players with little fuss. Trivial purchases are small enough that players don't have to keep track of the money used for trivial purchases at all. It is assumed that characters have either income or savings from which they spend to pay for their trivial purchases with no meaningful net gain or loss. (w00t communisim; w00t privledge).

### Minor Purchases
Next, minor purchases are things like tools, weapons and armor, vehicles, medicine, and jewelrey. Minor purchases are typically worth one CP and should be represented as the flavor `minor purchase`. A character can have multiple of the `minor purchase` flavor.

### Major Purchases
Major purchases are just like minor purchases except they can purchase more expensive things. Major purchases can typically purchase companies, elite training, houses, spaceships and the like. Major purchases should be represented as the flavor `major purchase` as many times as is necessary.

### Priceless Purchases
Lastly and of least importance we have priceless purchases. Priceless purchases are things that are so expensive that no character has any hope of ever purchasing them.

## Social Flavor
The in-game doors that position and status unlock are also represented by flavor. Typically this might look like `respected businessman`, `landed noble`, `kings advisor`, or `internet personality`. The effect of this stuff is purely RP and it will be up to the player to use it to its fullest. A character's job is always worth having as flavor because this has social implications in most societies. A character may or may not have a reputation but if they do it is worth putting down what it is and what group of people will know about it.

## Supernatural Flavor
Supernatural flavor is how one might represent being a priest to a specific god. Seriously just put down `priest of Khorn` to be that. Similarly if a character is `haunted`, `blessed`, or in a `demonic pact` just put those things down. That covers the social aspect of supernatual flavor. On the other hand a character could be `magically adept`, `unnaturally sweaty`, or `the chosen one`.

## Relationships
If you have another character as a companion you should list them as flavor or make a character sheet for them. Any animal companions, demonic familiars, slaves, shipboard AI, or loyal friends should be either listed as flavor or have their own character sheet made or both. Whatever is most apt. Consult the deals section and the storyteller.

## Knowledge
Knowledge should be represented as flavor unless that knowledge would be better represented as a skill. You cannot have a flavor and skill that are functionally identical such that the flavor just lowers the difficulty on all of that skills checks. Languages, secrets, history, specific domains of skilled labor, culture, religious rites, etc. are all examples of in character knowledge that should be represented as flavor.

## Vehicles and Properties
Horses, boats, spaceships, cars, planes, tanks, etc.
Houses, castles, countries, skyscrapers, private islands, secret bases, etc.

## Physical
Physicality is also represented as flavor. This includes but is not limited to body type, species, race, deformities, aesthetic, and disabilities. An example of each, in order, would be `fat`, `human`, `white`, `missing an ear`, `well dressed`, and `peg-leg`.

# Combat 
Combat in Tabula, like many RPGs, is turn based. Players will take turns describing their action, rolling checks to determine the result of their attempted actions, and the storyteller will narrate how things unfold.

## Rolling Initiative
To start a combat scene each character involved will need to roll initiative. To do this each character rolls one d6. The number of pips represents how many turns it will be until that character can act in the combat. I haven't decided if starting delay should be 1d6 or 1d6+AD (AD=a characters action delay).

## Transitions
Feel tree to maintain or drop initiative as you switch between chases, combats, and stealth scenes. Use logic to determine when it appropriate to switch between these and when to roll and drop initiative. Characters that start a combat or chase should go first. Characters need to be hidden if they want to start a stealth scene. Any of these can transition into any of the others. Chases are just combat with movement instead of fighting. Iniative for chases and combats works the same.

## Turns
Character get turns in combat based on their action delay. Effectively a character's action delay determines the cooldown on their actions. If a character has an action delay of 5 they will get to act every 5 ticks of initiative. If they started on initiative tick 8 this means they will act on 8, 13, 18, 23 and so on. Characters that start a combat go on 0. Other characters get 1d6 action delay before they can act in the combat. When a character's turn rolls around they get all of their spent actions back.
At the start of their turn a characters actions refresh. Actions include a major action, a move action, and a reaction. A move action can be moved for moving and occasionally for dodging when combined with a reaction. A reaction can be spent to hold your action. An action can be used for pretty much everything. A reaction can be used to make a dodge or block check. Major actions are usually used for attacking or interacting in combat. A major action can be used with a reaction to launch a counterattack. Lots of things are free actions: Talking and directing minions is a good example of this. Doing a defensive action for another player costs a reaction and a major action. Whenever you use you reaction you get to take a defensive action as long as it makes sense. Whenever you want to use a move or major action and it is not your tick of initiative it will cost your reaction. Major actions can also be replaced with an additional move action or reaction.

### Major Actions
Major actions are used to do pretty much everything in combat other than move or take out-of-turn actions. Most of the time you will need to use a major action to attack, interact with the invironment, cast spells, create advantages or disadvantages, etc.

#### Attacking
Attacking costs an action. To attack a character describe how you want to do that and the storyteller will tell you how hard that will be either before or possibly after the roll if that is hidden information--no take-backsies. The difference between what flavor you use to make the attack and what flavor the defender uses to defend from it determines the subjective difficulty of this roll. Make the roll. Each success lets you inflict one piece of flavor on the defender correlated with the attack you made. If you are attacking with a sword you can do "sword damage" as flavor which might look like impaling, hamstringing, or severing limbs. The storyteller can assign lethal damage to NPCs to speed up combat. Players cannot assign lethal damage.

##### Armor and Weapons
Armor and weapons porvide no statistical bonuses. Weapons are used to determine the types of bad flavor an attacker can inflict on a defender. Both are used to determine the subjective difficulty of attack rolls. Attacking an armored knight with a sword is hard but attacking him with a lightsaber is easy. If it were sword vs leather armor it would probably be a normal roll.

##### Damage, Wounds, and Death
Whenever a character rolls successes on anundefended attack action they deal damage. In Tabula, damage is dealt in the form of bad flavor. Players cannot give NPCs immediately lethal flavor and the storyteller cannot give the players immediately lethal flavor unless both parties agree. If wounds (bad flavor from combat) would make a character's ability to move non-trivial, that character is downed. If a character's ability to perform actions ever becomes impossible that character is either unconsions or incapacitated and possibly dead. If a character is ever incapacitated, downed, or unconsion they are likely at risk of being killed by a coup de gras. For all of these things make "does this make sense" checks.

##### Damage and Wounds 2
I think it might work to have a CC/damage point buy system that allows any attack to deal those effects as long as it makes sense.
```
CC store: temporary CC, until cleansed CC, encounter-long CC, permanent CC, unconsious
Damage store: minor asthetic wounds, wounds that contribute to making rolls harder, ???, death.
perhaps make it a mix and match style effect: permanent//temporary, difficulty increaser or no, action disabler or no, etc.
```
This point-buy system seems complicated. I think I am going to scrap it in favor of "all attacks are called shots. modify the difficulty accordingly. if your attack connects what you described happens*. *= unless the thing you attacked had plot armor"

##### Death 2
allow everyone to attempt killshots. Have plot armor automatically downgrade this unless the character is downed/incapacitated/unconsious.

#### advantages and disadvantages
As an action character may attempt to create an advantage for themselves or a disadvantage for another character. If the action succeeds whomever is controlling the character gets to describe the advantage they create. If the storyteller finds it reasonable it happens. If not, don’t waste time arguing, just move on.
An advantage can also take the form of having to roll fewer dice on a skill check in the future, extra damage dice on an attack roll, or a bonus to initiative. Inversely an advantage might mean that the character’s opponents have to roll more dice on skill checks, get fewer dice on their damage rolls, or lose initiative.

### Move Actions
Move actions are the simplest of the actions. If you need to change zones in battle you will need to make a move action. That said small bits of movement in the same zone like footwork in combat or walking two meters to a different computer terminal would not be considered large enough movement to require a move action. Sometimes when using a reaction to dodge the dodge won't make sense unless it also moves you. In this case you will also need a move action.

#### Zones
Rather than using a traditional grid I would recommend forming zones for your combat scene. If you want to use an image as a map you can either subdivide the sections of the map into large sections or overlay a large grid on the image to form zones. These zones should be about the size of one movement action. If you are simply describing a map you can just describe the zones. Each movement action will allow a player to change zones. There are no meaningful units of distance in this system. Use your brain if something that requires distance comes up.

#### Dodging
Some defensive actions require a character to get out of the way to avoid an attack. In these cases character will need to spend a movement action in addition to a reaction to make a defensive action.

### Reactions
Reactions are actions that characters can use to act out of turn. This is most commonly used for defensive actions. Anytime a character uses their reaction they can make a free defensive action. Acting out of turn to counterattack, defend yourself or another character, or by holding a major action all require a character's reaction.

#### Defensive Actions
Defensive actions are those that characters do to avoid the bad flavor that comes with an attack. Commonly this means blocking, dodging, parrying, etc. Uncommonly this means counterattacking to remove a threat before it can hurt you, or jumping in front of an attack for another character.




## Grouping NPCs
I haven't found a good way to do this yet. One idea is to treat them as though they have banding and make their attacks, movements, and defensive actions all on the same turn. Another way would be to treat them as a group that attacks and defends as one with large difficulty modifiers. A third option would be to track each units flavor separately but take turns for the group based on the number of units in the group, such that each additional member decreases the action delay.

### War
Once the number of NCPs gets into the double digits it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to actually play the individual characters in combat. In this case the NPCs battle is best described narratively with the PCs party being able to influence the outcome directly. This is also a good time to include the event die.

# Stealth and Perception

### information in roleplaying
there are a few kinds of info: info freely given to the players by the DM so they can play the game, info the DM hasn't thought about explicitly, and info the DM has thought about that must be earned with a check, and meta info like "that character got a name and a description: must be important".
stealth and lying are both methods characters use to conceal information from other characters.
Should we talk about passive perception values and whatnot? yeah that is a relevant discussion for attributes.
Notably, I classify “lying” as an information hiding skill, similar to “sneaking”, rather than as a persuasion skill.
this is all relevant for determining what rolls mean.
lying: first off you can't detect lying. you can detect if someone is uncomfortable or nervous or whatever and this can tip you off. flesh this bit out while reading Joe Navarro's body language manual. lying definitely cannot be used to convince another character of something but it can be used to convince them that you believe that thing. if you say the sky is red they wont believe you because they can just look up but if you are convincing they might believe you believe that. convincing someone of something that is false is a good time for a nested roll actually. one for the lie. one for the convincing.
i suppose there should be a lying differentiation section. if a character is lying to hide information that information it will be treated much like stealth. if you are attempting to convince a character of something that isn't true then just do a persuasion check modified by the plausibility of the lie. 
stealth: i am basing this bit on stealth games i have played. if you fail a stealth check you arent detected (except maybe on a crit). instead you do something that puts the "seekers" on alert and they start looking for you. if they pass their relevant observation checks THEN you get detected. If you pass your stealth check and the seekers start looking for you anyway then you can be detected if you are detectable. IF you are undetectable you cannot be detected but you can alert the seekers that you are there.
perception: if you go looking for something and you pass the check you find it IF it is there. if you fail the check you get no information either way. you just can't tell. this goes for spot checks, detecting intention in social situations, and searching for something.

## Hidden
Being hidden is the typical starting state for a stealth scene. If one character is hidden, other characters don't know they are there. Whenever they want to make actions they will have to roll stealth checks to avoid alerting other characters.

## Alerted
Alerted characters are those who have seen, heard, smelled, or sensed something strange and are going to look around for it. They can make various perception checks like investigation, searching, seeing, smelling, etc. to try and uncover hidden thigns and characters. If an alerted character succeeds at their check to detect a hidden character then the hidden character goes from hidden to detected.

## Detected
Detected characters are no longer hidden or in stealth. Everyone can interact with them normally or as though their location is known.

## Suprise
When a character or synchronized group of hidden characters start a combat they start on turn 0 at the very beginning of the initiative track. Other characters roll for initiative in the usual way.

# Persuasion, Willpower, and Motivations

## Persuasion
Persuasion is a mandatory skill in most settings. It is any character's ability to pursuade another character to think or do something. It is resisted by willpower and the difficulty of both rolls is strongly affected by motivations.

## Motivations
Motivations are what a character wants. These are a characters dreams, long term goals, morality, and fears. Some examples of motivations are `family legacy`, `money`, `serving the gods`, `following the law`, `afraid of spiders`, `pride`, and many many more. Motivations strongly influence the difficulty of most persuasion and willpower rolls.

## Willpower
You can only defend if you know you are being attacked. if we have attributes all characters get a check against persuasion. otherwise they don't unless they have a relevant skill. Mandatory skills make this a lot better. Everyone has to have the `willpower` skill perhaps?
this is a good time to mention that when you try to convince a character of something they dont _have_ to be convinced. instead they can thing about it a bit and roll some relevant "resist persuasion" rolls which probably uses __willpower__. It is worth noting that not every persuasion roll needs an acompanying willpower roll to resist it. Sometimes a character has no reason to attempt to rest a persuasion roll.

# Setting
A setting is a template for worldbuilding. It includes a description of the world, the typical speed of characters in the world for combat purposes, how many character points new characters in the world should start with, a list of mandatory skills, and a list of skills common within the setting. The description usually includes a the technologocal level, magic, history, spacial/geographic scope, flora, fauna, biomes, natural resources, items, culture, store, etc.

## Description
Right now descriptions are a catch-all for things that go into a setting that I don't know how to articulate well enough to add to the template. *Otherwise*, the setting's description should just describe it in general terms. For example Middle Earth might be described as "a land of Men and magical creatures including Hobbits, Men, Elves, Dwarves, Treants, Draogons, etc. set in a medieval era. Magic permeates the land and peoples. Swords, sorcery, and adventure are what a player can expect."

## Action Delay
The default action delay for the setting is what all new characters in the setting will start with. This will guarantee that most of the characters in the setting are at about the same speed in combat and chases. Because it is just a default and can be modified it also allows for some characters to be faster or slower than the average character.

## Character Points
Character Points, also known as CP, are a resource used by players throughout the game to take new skills and flavor and level up existing skills. The suggested starting character points for a setting is basically a recommendation for starting level. If characters start with 30 CP rather than 25 they will be a little stronger on average. There is usually a positive correlation between the number of mandatory skills in a setting and the starting CP.

## Common/Available skills
Available skills are skills that every character in a setting has access to. Any character can learn these skills with storyteller approval either at character creation or during the story. Players are encouraged to suggest additions to the list of available skills for the setting. Available skills are where characters get their options for interesting actions. A few examples of available skills are `swordfighting`, `necromancy`, `seduction`, and `piloting`. Available skills can be purchased with CP at character creation and during the story by any character. Characters do not need to have every available skill.

## Mandatory Skills
Mandatory skills are those that every character must have to be make sure they will not have checks that they should be able to roll but cannot. For instance, `seeing` and `hearing` are both skills almost every humanoid character should have so that they can perceive the game world. Every character must have one level in every mandatory skill but can take more levels if they wish.

## Spacial Scope
Settings have a size. They might be the entire known universe but even that has a size. Tell your players what that is. It is worth noting that you can have settings that are smaller than the known world and have multiple settings within the same story. A map with a some kind of scale marker and a region marked out as the place the setting governs is a good idea.

## Technology and Magic
A couple of initial questions players usually have when they are making characters in a new setting are "Is there magic?" and "What is the technological level?" and for this reason the answers to these questions should be on the setting. They are commonly asked, important, and usually easy to answer. If there is any ficticious magic in the setting it should be described here.

## Store
<!-- use the various purchasing power columns trivial, minor, major, priceless and also include something for unavailable, illegal things -->
<!-- social: history, institutions, culture, peoples, cities, countries, government -->
<!-- physical: geography, biome, flora, fauna, natural resources -->
<!-- template -->

# Storyteller section  (perhaps merge this section with the related sections and include @storyteller: tags)
<!-- this section is at risk of being super preachy. -->
This section of the doc is to help storytellers play this system because it is a bit crazy. Making settings and NPCs will be the majority of this section though it is possible those should just be merged into their own sections in the main part of the book. There is some information that differs based on whether I am talking to a storyteller or a player though. Perhaps I should handle this in-line? Does any of it need to be kept secret from the players?

## Making a Setting
This section aims to outline the necessary steps and decisions that need to be made in order to create a setting. The subsections will correlate to the various pieces of a setting. To be mechanically playable a setting needs an action delay, starting character points, a list of mandatory skills, a list of common skills, and a description.

### Description
settings need descriptions to tell players about the world
> example: like the star wars universe
> example2: (an actual description)

### Action Delay and AUTs
Choosing a suitable action delay is fairly easy but it is possible to mess it up. If the action delay is too high, counting out AUTs becomes tedious and modifying a characters action delay by small numbers becomes less meaningful. On the other hand choosing a default action delay that is too low will greatly increase turn colissions and make it such that characters with non-default action delays have very different "speeds". Default action delay effectively determines the typical speed for characters in the setting. Having an abnormal action delay is how a character becomes faster or slower. AUTs are arbitrary units of time and I think this is what I will be calling initiative "ticks" because depending on the combat they can vary wildly.

### Starting Character Points


### Adding player-made skills to a Setting
Probably the coolest part of this system is that it allows players to make their own skills. This requires co-operation from you, the storyteller. Your job is to vet and occasionally veto skills players have proposed as additions to the setting. Rather than a veto however you can put some [limiting factors](#limiting-factors) on a skill to make it less disruptive.

#### problems with previous iterations of "players are allowed to create their own skills"
tl;dr players could make skills that were vague and applied to every scenario and then max them.
- using incredibly broad skills that apply to every scenario. "social graces" applies to every social situation, provides little character depth, and makes it so a player can use the dice to walk all over the game.
an example tree of skill scope
> animal skills  
>> riding  
>>> horses  
>>> camels  
>>> elephants  
>> driving  
>>> oxen  
>>> mules and horses  
>>> dogs  
>> care  
>>> grooming  
>>> feeding  
>>> breeding  
>>> veterinary  
>>>> first aid  
>>>> diagnosis  
>>>> medicine  
>>>> surgery    
A character might know “knots” because they know the skill “sailing” and that’s fine even though the character is getting a lot of skills for free under the umbrella-skill of “sailing”. 
On the other hand I encouraged THIS at one point.
perhaps settings should include a list of default/common skills?
there is something of a goldilocks zone for skill scope. Magic is too broat, fireball is too narrow, but fire magic is just right.

#### Limiting factors
To limit a how disruptive a skill can be to your story a few things are necessary. Firstly, make it clear to the players that while their character *might* be the first character to have a skill they will probably not be the only character to have this skill. Next adding a cooldown, timing restriction, or cost to a skill can go a long way to making the skill less disruptive. You will have to come up with your own rules regarding this. Keep in mind they should be short and simple.

### Money and Making the Store
Money in Tabula is handled with things called AUCs. An AUC is an arbitrary unit of currency. In this game an AUC might be 1000 spacebucks or $10 or an ounce of gold. The point is that it is money. The way Tabula organizes money is so that you don't have to do much bookeeping with your money. Groupings of AUCs form different levels of purchasing power. One AUC is one minor purchase. Three AUCs are a major purchase. There are 4 tiers of purchasing power. The first is trivial, then minor, major, and priceless. To ground this in the real human world trivial purchases are things like food, beer, candy, ammo, clothes, or entertainment. A minor purchase would be things that cost more like guns, cars, specialized tools, computers, or medicine. Major purchases would be things like houses, companies, famous art, fancy cars, or a college education. A priceless purchase is one that you simply cannot buy right now because it is either far to expensive or it is unavailable.
I think to actually make the store on the setting it should be the four columns with various goods underneath them. (columns are trivial, minor, major, and priceless)

<!--
    fill in th rest of the fields with lore shit i guess -->
<!-- npcs
    grouping them for combat is a pain. instead create squads. squads always act as a group and have enormous stats? eh, they don't work well for this.
 -->

## NPCs

### Persuasion
It is best to give your NPCs a couple short motivations to make pursuading them less like talking to a well. If an NPC is motivated by money I would think bribes would be fairly evvective. If instead they are modivated by principles then asking them to do the right thing might be more effective.

### Planned NPCs
same as PCs but don't spend ALL of their exp immediately. allow them to fudge the numbers and gain skills as needed. maybe create their special skill if they have one immediately. give them character points at the same rate as PCs.

### Unplanned NPCs
I recommend rolling dice to determine skill levels and then standardizing the character's stats with the parties CP later.

### grouping NPCS
possibly include a mirror version of this system for the combat section
provide some simple method of grouping NPCs in combat
This will probably also end up being the mechanic for co-op actions, assisted rolls, etc. Flavor damage will probably be spread out.
