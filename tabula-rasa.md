# Tabula Rasa

## Intro
Tabula Rasa is a worldbuilding framework and a rules-light, generic roleplaying game that lets players create their own skills.

The worldbuilding framework produces a Setting. Settings are short, standardized, and easily sharable descriptions of a single place within a world. The intent is that Settings can be used to quickly understand a part of the world such that a player can create a Character or the Storyteller can create an Adventure.

The roleplaying system is generic so it will work with any Setting produced by the worldbuilding framework. The rules are minimal meaning you and your group should be able to create any character imaginable within the setting and start playing very quickly!

## Character Creation
Characters need skills, flavor and an action delay to be playable. The first thing a player should do when making a character is take a look at the [setting](#setting), read through it and make sure they understand the world. Players can propose things be added to the setting because they are supposed to have a mild influence upon what exists within the setting.

First fill out the top of your character sheet. In order, the boxes should contain the character's name, the character's concept, the setting's name, your name, and the setting's action delay. A character concept can be thought of as the canonical or stereotypical version of something. The setting's action delay can be found in the upper left corner of the setting template.

Second, your character needs [skills](#skills). Skills are used to roll checks which is how a character interacts with the game world. Skills are usually self-descriptively named and have levels. The higher level the skill the better at it a character is.
There are two kinds of skills. Mandatory skills and the normal kind. Mandatory skills are skills every character _needs_ within the setting. They are listed at the top of the skills section in the setting. Add all of the mandatory skills to your character sheet. The rest of the skills are those that are common within the setting and you can take any of them you can afford. Players can also propose to the storyteller that skills be added to the setting. You pay for your starting skills using character points. Starting character points are listed in the upper left of the setting. Skills cost a number of character points equal to the level you want the skill to start at.

```
Example mandatory skills: willpower, strength, magic, dexterity, charisma
Example skills: sword fighting, pyromancy, computer hacking, seduction
```

Third, your character needs [flavor](#flavor). Flavor is a word or short phrase describing a character. It can include knowledge, possessions, physique, and even social position. Review the starting flavor options listed on the setting. This will almost always give your character a language, clothes, and equipment relevant for the setting. When the setting specifies a type of flavor but not what it is specifically you get to choose something that would fit within the setting. Add your choice of starting flavor to your character sheet. Afterward, add flavor to your character to describe them. Flavor costs one character point per after you have your starting flavor. Flavor is usually just that, flavor, but occasionally it can make checks easier or harder.

## How to Play
Tabula Rasa is a roleplaying game. Experienced roleplayers can now proceed to the [Checks](#checks) section. For everyone else, roleplaying is a form of collaborative, improvizational storytelling.

One person, the storyteller, will present a world and a story. The storyteller can use a world, or setting, of their own design or one from popular media. The [setting](#setting) section has more details on what you can expect from this ficticious world. The storyteller is also responsible for giving the world life. They plan out scenes between players and NPCs, provide the decisions and voice acting for NPCs, and narrate events in the world to drive the story they have planned.

The rest of the people in a roleplaying game are players. Usually, players will create a character for the game. See the [character_creation](#character-creation) section for help with this. Once a player has a character, they will provide voice acting, motivations, and personality for the character in addition to controlling their actions within the fictious realm of the story.

A night of roleplaying usually lasts anywhere from two to six hours and usually includes a variety of scenes. Exhilirating chases, nail-biteing espionage, terrifying battles, grand speeches, descriptions of exotic lands, and of course joking around in and out of character are all hallmarks of good roleplaying.

Most good stories include conflict. This will usually end up being between the the player-characters and either NPCs or some other element in the story. When a conflict arises, resolve it by rolling a skill-check. Please see the [checks](#checks) section for help with this.

### Checks
When conflict occurs during roleplaying the fairest way to resolve it most times is by rolling a skill-check. A skill-check is where one of a character's skills is tested against some number of dice which represent the difficulty of the task. If the character's skill is greater than or equal to the sum of the dice then the character passes the skill-check. Usually this will also mean that whatever the character was attmepting to accomplish succeeds. If the dice are greater than the character's skill level the action fails and something bad might happen. The number of dice depends on the difficulty of the task. Flavor can influence difficulty.

#### Difficulty
The difficulty of a skill check can be modified by a number of things. A character's flavor, other characters, and the world itself can all cause a skill-check to become easier or harder. The storyteller decides if any of these things is meaningful enough to make the roll easy or hard.
| subjective difficulty | dice representation  |
| --------------------- | -------------------- |
| easy                  | pass if skill >= 1d6 |
| normal                | pass if skill >= 2d6 |
| hard                  | pass if skill >= 3d6 |
| harder                | pass if skill >= 4d6 |
| etc.                  | pass if skill >= 5d6 |

#### Nested Checks
If a character is trying to do two things at once, juggling while doing a backflip for instance, just increase the difficulty. If a player is doing two things that are radically different, that is the apropriate time to make two skill checks. (Doing a backflip and casting a spell)

#### Progression
To level up a skill you need to pass skill checks with it. Whenever you pass a skill-check with a skill add one to that skill's experience. When the skill's experience is equal to it's level it levels up and the experience resets to zero. You can only level up a skill at level one by making the check easy.

#### Event Die
The storyteller can introduce the event die whenever they want. Basically when a check is rolled an additional d6 is rolled. If this d6 comes up 1 something bad might happen and if it comes up 6 something good might happen. It is best to have an extra d6 of a different color if you are going to add the event die to every roll. The event die is a convenient way to handle crits and crit fails in this system.

#### Gambits
Gambits are where you make a deal with the storyreller to modify the the difficulty of a check, the pass-effect, and the fail-effect. You might ask for something special to happen on a success in exchange for an increase in difficulty.

#### Magnitude of Success

If you ever need a magnitude of success for a roll, like damage or crafting, just roll a single d6 and use this chart.

| Die result | Magnitude of success |
| :--------: | :------------------: |
|   6 pip    |         100%         |
|   5 pip    |         80%          |
|   4 pip    |         60%          |
|   3 pip    |         40%          |
|   2 pip    |         20%          |
|   1 pip    |          0%          |



#### Example
<!-- this should be right after the description probably? -->
For example lets say John, the NPC character wants to do a backflip. The first thing John will do is look for a relevant skill on his character sheet. `Acrobatics`, `athletics`, `dexterity`, `phisique` or anything similar will work for this check. Lets say John has an `acrobatics` score of 11. Lets also say John has the flavor `leg wound` from a fight he got into recently. This would make the check hard, so john would be rolling 3d6 against his 11 in `acrobatics`. Lets say John gets a sum of 10 on the dice. This means John was able to successfully do a backflip despite his `leg wound`.

#### Contests
For contests like arm wrestling, racing, or anything else where two known values are being compared (both character's skill values are known so dice aren't needed) just have each roll a check as normal. Do this until one character fail's a check. If neither character can fail the check the stroyteller decides what happens.

## Skills 
Each character has a list of skills representing the actions they can take in the story. Skills do have to be things that a character can *do* which also means they have to be able to fail as well. The setting will have a comprehensive list of skills available in the setting.
<!-- examples -->



### Mandatory Skills
All characters should have the ability to attack, defend, move, hide, see, lie, detect lies, persuade, resist persuasion, etc. The list of mandatory skills on the setting should represent these potential actions. All characters must have all mandatory skills for their setting.
<!-- common -->
<!-- acquisition
    no matching skill problem -->

### Progression
Skills level up once they have been used a number of times equal to their level. For example, to level up a level 7 `sword-fighting` a player would need to succeed at 7 `sword-fighting` checks. This usually means this will require over 7 attempts because failures do not earn exp. Mark successes next to the skill on your character sheet. 
<!-- common skills -->
<!-- mandatory skills -->

### Contests as checks
Each participant in the contest rolls. Anyone who fails is eliminated/loses. If using a dice system where magnitude of success is easy to calculate the player with the most successes wins the contest. Contestants can tie. All modifiers apply to the checks as normal.

## Flavor
<!-- definition -->
<!-- examples -->
<!-- things (equipment, money, vehicles)
    from setting: store and black market
    crafting -->

### money
I am thinking i want to have a chart somewhere that handles things like store prices and loot by asking the dm to define one unit of currency and then derive all the prices in their world based on some percentage or multiple of this. this would also give the DM a good time to think about what things are available or not and what things are scarce or plentiful and adjust prices and availability accordingly. Talk about money in the doc as AUCs (arbitrary units of currency). really I think this should be a part of the "settings" section.
If i decide to give items a level/numeric value it would make sense to have them be orders of magnitude more and less expensive based on those numbers.

#### Money2
I would like to handle money the way stefan handled it in "What Stars!". The way he did this was by having VTM style resource backgrounds with some minor mods. Each background gives you either a major purchase or three minor purchases. they regenerate based on story stuff. major and minor purchases can purchase things like that. Minor purchases might be a night at an inn or a meal at a restaurant. Major purchases would be things like weapons and armor and jewelery and horses and spaceships and shit. Some things might cost multiple major purchases. Trivial purchases should be day-to-day expenses like food.

<!-- acquisition -->

## Combat 
<!-- description of process -->
<!-- starting combat ie. rolling initiative (surprise) -->

### Transitions
Feel tree to maintain or drop initiative as you switch between chases, combats, and stealth scenes. Use logic to determine when it appropriate to switch between these and when to roll and drop initiative. Characters that start a combat or chase should go first. Characters need to be hidden if they want to start a stealth scene. Any of these can transition into any of the others. Chases are just combat with movement instead of fighting. Iniative for chases and combats works the same.

### Turns
Character get turns in combat based on their action delay. Effectively a character's action delay determines the cooldown on their actions. If a character has an action delay of 5 they will get to act every 5 ticks of initiative. If they started on initiative tick 8 this means they will act on 8, 13, 18, 23 and so on. Characters that start a combat go on 0. Other characters get 1d6 action delay before they can act in the combat. When a character's turn rolls around they get all of their spent actions back.

#### Actions
At the start of their turn a characters actions refresh. Actions include a major action, a move action, and a reaction. A move action can be moved for moving and occasionally for dodging when combined with a reaction. A reaction can be spent to hold your action. An action can be used for pretty much everything. A reaction can be used to make a dodge or block check. Major actions are usually used for attacking or interacting in combat. A major action can be used with a reaction to launch a counterattack. Lots of things are free actions: Talking and directing minions is a good example of this. Doing a defensive action for another player costs a reaction and a major action. Whenever you use you reaction you get to take a defensive action as long as it makes sense. Whenever you want to use a move or major action and it is not your tick of initiative it will cost your reaction. Major actions can also be replaced with an additional move action or reaction.

##### Major Actions
Major actions are used to do pretty much everything in combat other than move or take out-of-turn actions. Most of the time you will need to use a major action to attack, interact with the invironment, cast spells, create advantages or disadvantages, etc.

###### Attacking
Attacking costs an action. To attack a character describe how you want to do that and the storyteller will tell you how hard that will be either before or possibly after the roll if that is hidden information--no take-backsies. The difference between what flavor you use to make the attack and what flavor the defender uses to defend from it determines the subjective difficulty of this roll. Make the roll. Each success lets you inflict one piece of flavor on the defender correlated with the attack you made. If you are attacking with a sword you can do "sword damage" as flavor which might look like impaling, hamstringing, or severing limbs. The storyteller can assign lethal damage to NPCs to speed up combat. Players cannot assign lethal damage.

###### advantages and disadvantages
As an action character may attempt to create an advantage for themselves or a disadvantage for another character. If the action succeeds whomever is controlling the character gets to describe the advantage they create. If the storyteller finds it reasonable it happens. If not, don’t waste time arguing, just move on.
An advantage can also take the form of having to roll fewer dice on a skill check in the future, extra damage dice on an attack roll, or a bonus to initiative. Inversely an advantage might mean that the character’s opponents have to roll more dice on skill checks, get fewer dice on their damage rolls, or lose initiative.

##### Move Actions
Move actions are the simplest of the actions. If you need to change zones in battle you will need to make a move action. That said small bits of movement in the same zone like footwork in combat or walking two meters to a different computer terminal would not be considered large enough movement to require a move action. Sometimes when using a reaction to dodge the dodge won't make sense unless it also moves you. In this case you will also need a move action.
<!-- movement
    ZONES
    DODGING?-->
<!-- reactions
    defensive actions -->
<!-- description of one turn-->


### Movement, Distance, and Zones
Rather than using a traditional grid I would recommend forming zones for your combat scene. If you want to use an image as a map you can either subdivide the sections of the map into large sections or overlay a large grid on the image to form zones. If you are simply describing a map you can just describe the zones. Each movement action will allow a player to change zones. There are no meaningful units of distance in this system. Use your brain if something that requires distance comes up.


#### Armor and Weapons
Armor and weapons porvide no statistical bonuses. Weapons are used to determine the types of bad flavor an attacker can inflict on a defender. Both are used to determine the subjective difficulty of attack rolls. Attacking an armored knight with a sword is hard but attacking him with a lightsaber is easy. If it were sword vs leather armor it would probably be a normal roll.

#### Damage, Wounds, and Death
Whenever a character rolls successes on anundefended attack action they deal damage. In Tabula, damage is dealt in the form of bad flavor. Players cannot give NPCs immediately lethal flavor and the storyteller cannot give the players immediately lethal flavor unless both parties agree. If wounds (bad flavor from combat) would make a character's ability to move non-trivial, that character is downed. If a character's ability to perform actions ever becomes impossible that character is either unconsions or incapacitated and possibly dead. If a character is ever incapacitated, downed, or unconsion they are likely at risk of being killed by a coup de gras. For all of these things make "does this make sense" checks.

##### Damage and Wounds
I think it might work to have a CC/damage point buy system that allows any attack to deal those effects as long as it makes sense.
```
CC store: temporary CC, until cleansed CC, encounter-long CC, permanent CC, unconsious
Damage store: minor asthetic wounds, wounds that contribute to making rolls harder, ???, death.
perhaps make it a mix and match style effect: permanent//temporary, difficulty increaser or no, action disabler or no, etc.
```

##### Death
allow everyone to attempt killshots. Have plot armor automatically downgrade this unless the character is downed/incapacitated/unconsious.
<!-- roll a check for to-hit
    Flavor effect: items, weapons, armor, wounds, etc.
    damage, wounds, death -->
<!-- grouping NPCs for ease of play (minions)
    large scale: wars/double-digit followers-->

## Stealth and Perception

#### information in roleplaying
there are a few kinds of info: info freely given to the players by the DM so they can play the game, info the DM hasn't thought about explicitly, and info the DM has thought about that must be earned with a check, and meta info like "that character got a name and a description: must be important".
stealth and lying are both methods characters use to conceal information from other characters.
Should we talk about passive perception values and whatnot? yeah that is a relevant discussion for attributes.
Notably, I classify “lying” as an information hiding skill, similar to “sneaking”, rather than as a persuasion skill.
this is all relevant for determining what rolls mean.
lying: first off you can't detect lying. you can detect if someone is uncomfortable or nervous or whatever and this can tip you off. flesh this bit out while reading Joe Navarro's body language manual. lying definitely cannot be used to convince another character of something but it can be used to convince them that you believe that thing. if you say the sky is red they wont believe you because they can just look up but if you are convincing they might believe you believe that. convincing someone of something that is false is a good time for a nested roll actually. one for the lie. one for the convincing.
i suppose there should be a lying differentiation section. if a character is lying to hide information that information it will be treated much like stealth. if you are attempting to convince a character of something that isn't true then just do a persuasion check modified by the plausibility of the lie. 
stealth: i am basing this bit on stealth games i have played. if you fail a stealth check you arent detected (except maybe on a crit). instead you do something that puts the "seekers" on alert and they start looking for you. if they pass their relevant observation checks THEN you get detected. If you pass your stealth check and the seekers start looking for you anyway then you can be detected if you are detectable. IF you are undetectable you cannot be detected but you can alert the seekers that you are there.
perception: if you go looking for something and you pass the check you find it IF it is there. if you fail the check you get no information either way. you just can't tell. this goes for spot checks, detecting intention in social situations, and searching for something.
<!-- hidden -->
<!-- alerted -->
<!-- detected -->
<!-- surprise -->

## Lying and Detecting Lies
<!-- suspicious -->
<!-- fooled -->
<!-- caught -->

## Persuasion and Willpower
<!-- motivations -->

### Willpower
You can only defend if you know you are being attacked. if we have attributes all characters get a check against persuasion. otherwise they don't unless they have a relevant skill. Mandatory skills make this a lot better. Everyone has to have the `willpower` skill perhaps?
this is a good time to mention that when you try to convince a character of something they dont _have_ to be convinced. instead they can thing about it a bit and roll some relevant "resist persuasion" rolls which probably uses __willpower__.
<!-- should this even be a section? -->

## Setting
A setting is a template for worldbuilding. It includes a description of the world, the typical speed of characters in the world for combat purposes, how many character points new characters in the world should start with, a list of mandatory skills, and a list of skills common within the setting. The description usually includes a the technologocal level, magic, history, spacial/geographic scope, flora, fauna, biomes, natural resources, items, culture, store, etc.
<!-- description (every setting has one)-->

### Action Delay
The default action delay for the setting is what all new characters in the setting will start with. This will guarantee that most of the characters in the setting are at about the same speed in combat and chases. Because it is just a default and can be modified it also allows for some characters to be faster or slower than the average character.
<!-- character points -->
<!-- common skills -->

### Mandatory Skills
Mandatory skills are those that every character must have to be make sure they will not have checks that they should be able to roll but cannot. For instance, `seeing` and `hearing` are both skills almost every humanoid character should have so that they can perceive the game world. Every character must have one level in every mandatory skill but can take more levels if they wish.
<!-- spacial scope -->
<!-- technology/magic -->
<!-- store, black market, currency, templates w/ price ratios -->
<!-- social: history, institutions, culture, peoples, cities, countries, government -->
<!-- physical: geography, biome, flora, fauna, natural resources -->
<!-- template -->

## Glossary of Terms
<!-- storyteller, character, player, NPC, roleplaying, worldbuilding, setting, battlegrid -->

## Storyteller section 
<!-- this section is at risk of being super preachy. -->
This section of the doc is to help storytellers play this system because it is a bit crazy. Making settings and NPCs will be the majority of this section though it is possible those should just be merged into their own sections in the main part of the book. There is some information that differs based on whether I am talking to a storyteller or a player though. Perhaps I should handle this in-line? Does any of it need to be kept secret from the players?

### Making a Setting
This section aims to outline the necessary steps and decisions that need to be made in order to create a setting. The subsections will correlate to the various pieces of a setting. To be mechanically playable a setting needs an action delay, starting character points, a list of mandatory skills, a list of common skills, and a description.

#### Description
settings need descriptions to tell players about the world
> example: like the star wars universe
> example2: (an actual description)

#### Action Delay and AUTs
Choosing a suitable action delay is fairly easy but it is possible to mess it up. If the action delay is too high, counting out AUTs becomes tedious and modifying a characters action delay by small numbers becomes less meaningful. On the other hand choosing a default action delay that is too low will greatly increase turn colissions and make it such that characters with non-default action delays have very different "speeds". Default action delay effectively determines the typical speed for characters in the setting. Having an abnormal action delay is how a character becomes faster or slower. AUTs are arbitrary units of time and I think this is what I will be calling initiative "ticks" because depending on the combat they can vary wildly.

#### Starting Character Points


#### Adding player-made skills to a Setting
Probably the coolest part of this system is that it allows players to make their own skills. This requires co-operation from you, the storyteller. Your job is to vet and occasionally veto skills players have proposed as additions to the setting. Rather than a veto however you can put some [limiting factors](#limiting-factors) on a skill to make it less disruptive.

##### problems with previous iterations of "players are allowed to create their own skills"
tl;dr players could make skills that were vague and applied to every scenario and then max them.
- using incredibly broad skills that apply to every scenario. "social graces" applies to every social situation, provides little character depth, and makes it so a player can use the dice to walk all over the game.
an example tree of skill scope
> animal skills  
>> riding  
>>> horses  
>>> camels  
>>> elephants  
>> driving  
>>> oxen  
>>> mules and horses  
>>> dogs  
>> care  
>>> grooming  
>>> feeding  
>>> breeding  
>>> veterinary  
>>>> first aid  
>>>> diagnosis  
>>>> medicine  
>>>> surgery    
A character might know “knots” because they know the skill “sailing” and that’s fine even though the character is getting a lot of skills for free under the umbrella-skill of “sailing”. 
On the other hand I encouraged THIS at one point.
perhaps settings should include a list of default/common skills?
there is something of a goldilocks zone for skill scope. Magic is too broat, fireball is too narrow, but fire magic is just right.

##### Limiting factors
To limit a how disruptive a skill can be to your story a few things are necessary. Firstly, make it clear to the players that while their character *might* be the first character to have a skill they will probably not be the only character to have this skill. Next adding a cooldown, timing restriction, or cost to a skill can go a long way to making the skill less disruptive. You will have to come up with your own rules regarding this. Keep in mind they should be short and simple.

#### Money and Making the Store
Money in Tabula is handled with things called AUCs. An AUC is an arbitrary unit of currency. In this game an AUC might be 1000 spacebucks or $10 or an ounce of gold. The point is that it is money. The way Tabula organizes money is so that you don't have to do much bookeeping with your money. Groupings of AUCs form different levels of purchasing power. One AUC is one minor purchase. Three AUCs are a major purchase. There are 4 tiers of purchasing power. The first is trivial, then minor, major, and priceless. To ground this in the real human world trivial purchases are things like food, beer, candy, ammo, clothes, or entertainment. A minor purchase would be things that cost more like guns, cars, specialized tools, computers, or medicine. Major purchases would be things like houses, companies, famous art, fancy cars, or a college education. A priceless purchase is one that you simply cannot buy right now because it is either far to expensive or it is unavailable.
I think to actually make the store on the setting it should be the four columns with various goods underneath them. (columns are trivial, minor, major, and priceless)

<!--
    fill in th rest of the fields with lore shit i guess -->
<!-- npcs
    grouping them for combat is a pain. instead create squads. squads always act as a group and have enormous stats? eh, they don't work well for this.

same as PCs but don't spend ALL of their exp immediately. allow them to fudge the numbers and gain skills as needed. maybe create their special skill if they have one immediately. give them character points at the same rate as PCs.

#### Unplanned NPCs
I recommend rolling dice to determine skill levels and then standardizing the character's stats with the parties CP later.

#### grouping NPCS
possibly include a mirror version of this system for the combat section
provide some simple method of grouping NPCs in combat
This will probably also end up being the mechanic for co-op actions, assisted rolls, etc. Flavor damage will probably be spread out.
