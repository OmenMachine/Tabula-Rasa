#Tabula Rasa
##Intro
##Definitions
Storyteller = DM (Dungeon Master)
##Required Materials
Character sheets, pencils/pens, and three six-sided dice. A map of the world, a battle-grid, and character models might help as well.
##Character Creation
Players should ask the Storyteller 
at one point i was strongly in favor of group character creation where the other players could modify your character in minor ways
###Attributes
it might be worthwhile to split stats into physical, mental, social, and magical. Of these mental is the most generically useless in a role-playing situation.
###Skills
All characters should have the ability to attack, defend, move, hide, see, lie, detect lies, persuade, resist persuasion and much more.
Skills are all made up and characters should be able to do each of these things with their skills. probably more things too
##skill checks
At some point i though about a magnitude of success table. I don't remember what it was based on.
At some point i thought it was  a good idea to have flavor. i think this gave bonuses/detriments on rolls.
###star wars check system
at some point i liked the star wars RPG system of dice having successes and "good stuff" on them and failures and "bad stuff". this led to a system where you could have phyrric victories and defeats that weren't all bad.
Decide whether or not i want crit successes and/or crit failures.
possibly put crits and crit fails on a separate die to control the probability of such.
buy successes/failures and good/bad stuff with pips on the relevant dice.
should rolls always be opposed?
at some point i was in favor of constructing skill checks based on positive and negative dice. negative dice represented the difficulty of the task and the difficulties resulting from the situation. positive dice would represent the character's skill at the task and any advantages they had towards completing the task. when all the positive and negative dice are rolled successes cancel failures and negatives cancel failures.
very good/bad stuff always overrides the other good/bad in the typical opposed roll.
a check fails if there are fewer successes than failures on the dice. it seems like this system expects you to purchase successes, failures, good stuff, and bad stuff. it also seems like it requires far more than three identical 6ds. it seems like it wants d10s and specfic symbols on those dice.
excess successes and failures contribute to magnitude of success.
excess good stuff and bad stuff mean nothing in particular.
net good/bad stuff means a bunch of good/bad story things happen. this might be a little insane if it happens to often. the DM only has to resolve one good/bad stuff per check
##Combat
It looks like i was favoring shadowrun style initiative/speed in the past
disallowing called shots in favor of the doubles -> dragon dice method from dragon age seems really good. shadowrun style initiative is where characters roll initiative and get a score, and then combat goes in rounds. Each round subtracts some number (10 in shadowrun) from each intiative and each character that still has a non-negative initiative score gets a turn.
###Armor
Armor should subtract from damage dealt
###Dodge
Dodge should be the opposition to to-hit rolls.
###Damage, Wounds, and Death
In the current moment i vote for either perma-death or no relevant hitpoints.
##Stealth
At some point I though spot checks were unnecessary. AT THE ITME i was fine with players rolling spot checks for info anyway if they were stuck in a roleplaying situation.
##experience and leveling up and new skills and flavor
get 1-2 exp per session/in-game night.
spend an experience to get the first level in a made-up skill (all skills are made up) but you may have to role-play the acquisition.
i guess you have to rolaply for new "flavor".
