# Tabula-Rasa
## About
This README is not intended to be part of Tabula Rasa. Instead it is a meta-document for tracking design, philosophy, formatting, and tasks. Created by Harley Dutton.

### From the Intro:
Tabula Rasa is a worldbuilding framework and a rules-light, generic roleplaying game that lets players create their own skills.

The worldbuilding framework produces a Setting. Settings are short, standardized, and easily sharable descriptions of a single place within a world. The intent is that Settings can be used to quickly understand a part of the world such that a player can create a Character or the Storyteller can create an Adventure.

The roleplaying system is generic so it will work with any Setting produced by the worldbuilding framework. The rules are minimal meaning you and your group should be able to create any character imaginable within the setting and start playing very quickly!

## Philosophy
- Plays fast
- Players make skills
- generic
- low entry barrier
- short
- not preachy
- fun > balance/realism
- avoid math/book-keeping
- dry using links; otherwise printable
- avoid charts/tables

## Design Options
<!--Use feature branches and a little merging to turn these on and off for various releases.-->
### Non-numeric combat
Characters will not have health, items will not have numeric values associated with them, and damage will be dealt in the form of wounds. Wounds are detrimental flavor based on the weapon and armor involved.
<!--The alternative would be to make a bunch of tables for and formulas for stuff-->
### No leveling up
<!-- Characters will start with a number of character points determined by the storyteller. -->
Characters will be created and level up using CP. This will make it easy to maintain the power level of the group and create characters quickly. The "Elder Scrolls Leveling" was neat but it was tedious and reuired lots of bookkeeping. It also gave players a perverse incentive to experience whore, manipulate check difficulty in strange ways, and it would over-reward skills a player used frequently even if the player wanted to be more focused in something they used infrequently. Lockpicking vs swordfighting.
### Gambits
At its most basic a gambit is a deal you make with the storyteller. Anyone can propose a gambit but all parties must agree before the dice are rolled for the gambit to take effect.
<!--Two common gambits would be to go for a called shot in combat or to take your time with an action out of combat. Raise the difficulty for the called shot and make it insta-kill. Lower the difficulty for the careful action and lower the quality of a success.-->
### No attributes
<!--This assumes that there will also be a list of common skills included with each setting-->
Rather than having a few attributes we could have a list of __mandatory skills__ for a setting. Every character would have to take some level in __all__ of these skills.

### Outstanding problems
THE RELATED SKILLS PROBLEM: how do you take new skills or make new characters in the system where skills level up independently? What if a character wants a skill similar to one of their existing skills but different? How do you make new characters or replacements when one dies in game? Elder scrolls leveling is messy...

THE CRAFTING PROBLEM: Either items have numbers (NO) or magnitude of success has no bearing on the item being created. This is okay if the player creating the item is specific about what they want and this modifies the difficulty.

THE WOUNDS AND DEATH PROBLEM: If we are saying MoS on attack rolls means you get to inflict bad flavor when does a character die? When they have a certain number of bad flavors? Who determines what flavor can be added to a character? Perhaps we should just have health? How do you determine when a character has accumulated enough flavor that they are unconsious or dead? This can probably be solved by saying "no giving immediately lethal flavor", "unconsious/downed characters can be coup de gra'ed", and adding a subjective system for when a character has a shit-pile of wounds they should probably go down. Not having source material makes combat messy... When moving is non-trivial (on the trivial, easy, normal, hard, impossible subjective check difficulty scale) a character is downed. When attacking is impossible a character can be considered impotent and initiative can be dropped.

ELDER SCROLLS LEVELING DOWNTIME: you can easily experience whore unless the DM goes outside the system to stop it. this is bad.
