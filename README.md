# Tabula-Rasa
## About
This README is not intended to be part of Tabula Rasa. Instead it is a meta-document for tracking design, philosophy, formatting, and tasks. Created by Harley Dutton.

## Philosophy
- Plays fast
- Players make skills
- generic
- low entry barrier
- short
- not preachy
- fun > balance/realism
- avoid math/book-keeping
- dry using links; otherwise printable
- avoid charts/tables

## Design Options
<!--Use feature branches and a little merging to turn these on and off for various releases.-->
### Non-numeric combat
Characters will not have health, items will not have numeric values associated with them, and damage will be dealt in the form of wounds. Wounds are detrimental flavor based on the weapon and armor involved.
<!--The alternative would be to make a bunch of tables for and formulas for stuff-->
### No leveling up
<!-- Characters will start with a number of character points determined by the storyteller. -->
Characters will not level up but skills will. Characters will not have levels or experience. Instead _skills_ will level up when the character passes a number of checks with the skill equal to the skill's level. Track a each skill's experience with tally marks next to the skill. To combat experience whoring, a character can train for 8 hours in game to make one check with the skill.
### Gambits
At its most basic a gambit is a deal you make with the storyteller. Anyone can propose a gambit but all parties must agree before the dice are rolled for the gambit to take effect.
<!--Two common gambits would be to go for a called shot in combat or to take your time with an action out of combat. Raise the difficulty for the called shot and make it insta-kill. Lower the difficulty for the careful action and lower the quality of a success.-->
### No attributes
<!--This assumes that there will also be a list of common skills included with each setting-->
Rather than having a few attributes we could have a list of __mandatory skills__ for a setting. Every character would have to take some level in __all__ of these skills.
