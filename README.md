# Tabula-Rasa
## About
This README is not intended to be part of Tabula Rasa. Instead it is a meta-document for tracking design, philosophy, formatting, and tasks. Created by Harley Dutton.

Tabula Rasa is a worldbuilding framework and a rules-light, generic roleplaying game that lets players create their own skills.

The worldbuilding framework produces a Setting. Settings are short, standardized, and easily sharable descriptions of a single place within a world. The intent is that Settings can be used to quickly understand a part of the world such that a player can create a Character or the Storyteller can create an Adventure.

The roleplaying system is generic so it will work with any Setting produced by the worldbuilding framework. The rules are minimal meaning you and your group should be able to create any character imaginable within the setting and start playing very quickly!

## Philosophy
- Plays fast
- Players make skills
- generic
- low entry barrier
- short
- not preachy
- fun > balance/realism
- avoid math/book-keeping
- DRY using links; otherwise printable
- avoid charts/tables (in the actual doc)

### Outstanding problems
DEATH BY FLAVOR: When does a character die? (when they gain a flavor that would kill them. use DTMS checks) When they have a certain number of bad flavors? (no, not by number) Who determines what flavor can be added to a character? (called shots, the player) Perhaps we should just have health? (no) How do you determine when a character has accumulated enough flavor that they are unconscious or dead? (DTMS check) This can probably be solved by saying the difficulty for giving immediately lethal flavor will usually be high against non-mooks unless you have silver bullets. Unconscious, sleeping, incapacitated, downed, etc. characters can be killed outright. When a character achieves the downed status from wounds is based on a DTMS check I guess? Not having source material makes combat messy... When moving is non-trivial (on the trivial, easy, normal, hard, impossible subjective check difficulty scale) a character is downed? When attacking is impossible a character can be considered impotent/incapacitated and initiative can be dropped.

## To Do
- **influence**
  - try to combine mental and social influence.
- **checks** <!-- continue bolding these top level bullets-->
  - make it clear that the order is 1. describe action, 2. set difficulty, 2.5. optional abort if impossible or challenge if unfair, 3. roll and resolve. Make this an image
  - make it clear here, in mandatory skills, or in the skill creation section that you will often be asked to roll using a relevant skill. this means you pick the skill. if you don't have a better one use a mandatory skill.
  - add a section for challenging the difficulty if I haven't already. vote. storyteller gets 1.5
  - redo the flowchart image in paint and include it.
- **setting**
  - add an example image/table for the store
  - add an example image for a whole setting doc
- **Character Creation**
  - reduce the "character creation" section and add sections to "character" (really just move them and refine both) (at this point just double check that character has definitions for everything it needs to have defs for.)
  - flavor cannot point to a specific skill. If a flavor boils down to "+1 to a skill" or "X skill is easy for me" it isn't really flavor. Instead it should have many ups and downs and they should be situational.
  - at skill/flavor creation, discuss power level as a limiting factor. it should be a consideration at the least.
  - at skill/flavor creation, discuss the typical use case and difficulty.
- **combat**
  - add running to actions (converting major to move)
  - define more free actions. possibly convert some to minor actions
  - consider renaming move action minor action and defining some minor actions
  - extended (multiple turn) actions?
  - cover sneaking and surprise in combat section. It doesn't belong in hidden info section as it only *uses* that system and isn't a part of it. surprise: starting the fight when no one is expecting it (quickdraw//sneak) lets you start on turn 0
  - suspicious characters get reactions. surprised characters do not.
  - if a character is surprised do they get a reaction? Players getting assassinated is :(. I don't think surprised characters get actions... storytellers will need to be responsible...
  - characters cannot deal flavor amounting to instant death to anyone except mooks. 
  - characters can deal "dying" at typical difficulty of hard. 
  - Stripping defences is normal difficulty. 
  - Making an attack hard to evade is difficulty hard. 
  - after defences are stripped dealing dying/death can be done at normal difficulty.
- **feedback**
  - which terms need to go in the glossary. does the glossary need to exist?
  - does the attacking section need subsections?
  - where do we need example images, charts, or descriptions?
  - define skills better. Heuristic: skills allow you to *do*
  - define flavor better. Heuristic: flavor represents thing you *are* or *have*
- **formatting**
  - format things using legend
  - put headings in title case
- **polish**
  - make the voice consistent ie. always speak to player
  - link things
  - add grammar check plugin (or just run a grammar check?)
  - make the images non-shit
  - export as PDF
