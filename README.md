# Tabula-Rasa
##About
This README is not intended to be part of Tabula Rasa. Instead it is a meta-document for tracking design philosophy, formatting, and tasks. Created by Harley Dutton.

###Design Philosophy
- plays quickly
- generic (works for any world)
- follows the DRY design philosophy (ToC and custom links)
- grammatically correct
- character creation should be fast
- should be one file (probably PDF) for ease of sharing
- low entry barrier (uses up to 3d6, character sheets, writing utensils and the rules (battle-grid optional)
- this document should not tell people how to roleplay. it should only be rules.

###Formatting Decisions
- include one definition and two examples for everything
- there should be a table of contents

###TO-DO
- [ ] decide how I will be formatting the elements of this document
- [ ] convert all the files in the github project to markdown files
- [ ] record the good ideas from old versions and remove the rest of them
- [ ] get a nav-bar for electronic versions of this
- [ ] host this on a website somewhere
- [ ] export the document as a PDF with pandoc for sublime
