# Tabula-Rasa
## About
This README is not intended to be part of Tabula Rasa. Instead it is a meta-document for tracking design, philosophy, formatting, and tasks. Created by Harley Dutton.

## Philosophy
- plays quickly and flexibly
- players can create their own skills within the bounds of the setting the storyteller lays out
- character creation is _fast_; one hour tops for new players.
- generic enough to work with any setting
- one file for ease of printing and online sharing
- low entry barrier (3d6, counters, paper, and pens)
- don't be preachy by telling people how they _should_ be roleplaying or storytelling
- don't let realism or balance get in the way of fun
- should not include any source material for a setting
- avoid complicated math
- avoid bookkeeping hell
- this is a roleplaying system first and a combat system second; design those aspects in that order
- the doc should be short; 10 pages max
- for every release watch an episode of critical roll and see if the system can simulate it
- avoid perverse incentives like experience whoring

## Design Options
### use branches to add/remove these experimental features
- Characters will not have health, items will not have numeric values associated with them, and damage will be detrimental flavor based on the weapon and armor involved. ALTERNATIVELY characters just have health, weapons and damage rolls, and armor providing numeric soak and penalties to relevant rolls.
- Characters will not have levels or experience. Instead skills will level up when the character passes a number of checks with the skill equal to the skill's level. To combat experience whoring, a character can train for 8 hours in game to make one check with the skill. ALTERNATIVELY Just go white wolf style with an experience pool, flat costs for new skills and scaling costs to level things up.
- ROUGH: I have an idea that maybe players can make DEALS with the storyteller while making checks. These deals would provide modifiers and additional effects. I had this idea mostly in relation to combat but it could also work well for more generic roleplaying. For combat it would be something like (i go and take a super recklessly hard swing at the guy: +1d6 damage, no reaction or "I wink at the shopkeeper while we are bartering": +1 to the roll, unknown social repercussions). ALTERNATIVELY don't include this option. perhaps call these deals GAMBITS and give them a cost to try, on success, or on failure, and some special effect on attempt, success, or failure.
- I need to have either a small set of generic default skills, a larger list of non-generic default skills, or attributes.

## Formatting 
- include one definition for terms
- include examples for things
- table of contents with links to section headers
- sections should contain links to other sections they reference
- legend detailing formatting choices
- one chart or table per page
- no page elements that cannot survive being printed (other than links)
- monospace for formulas and definitions
- block quotes for examples
- follows the DRY design philosophy by using links
- no misspellings and grammatically correct
- heading one will be reserved for the title at the very top
- headings two through four will be available for (sub)sections

## To-Do
- [ ] make a graph of topics with categories, subcategories, and relates-to edges
- [ ] record the good ideas from old versions and remove the rest of them
- [ ] decide how I will be formatting the elements of this document
- [ ] implement branch protection and then give Ethan access
- [ ] export the document as a PDF (with pandoc for sublime or an Atom plugin)  
- [ ] learn how to make a tree in markdown
- [ ] learn how to make tables in markdown
- [x] find out if there is a way to put (html stlyed) comments into a markdown doc
- [x] convert all the files in the github project to markdown files or txt
- [x] find a grammar checker (in sublime preferences > settings > "spell_check":true)
- [x] provide one example of each useful piece of markdown here instead and delete example.md  
- [x] learn markdown formatting
- [x] host on a website (github)
- [x] version project with github
