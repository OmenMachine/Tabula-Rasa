# Tabula-Rasa
this is going to be an excercise in markdown, organization, and concise techinical writing.
all the files should be .md's i guess. I should also probably get some editing tools for sublime to make this easier. something to make it so i can see markdown without uploading it would be good.


#TODO
get a plugin for vewing markdown previews
