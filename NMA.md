Harley’s RP system. I’m naming the system “No Monks Allowed” because dodging and unarmed combat are “unsupported” by default. (I haven't bothered to balance them.)


general:
You need pencil, paper, and 3d6. that is all.
Round down when dividing.
A skill check is passed when attribute+skill > 3d6. (attr + skill vs 3d6)
character creation:
Attributes have a maximum of 9 and a starting value of 2.
Generic skills have a maximum of 9 and a starting value of 1.
Player made skills have a maximum of 9 and a starting value of 0.
Make 5 or fewer skills. Link each with an attribute.
Distribute 32 points into the 9 attributes
Distribute 35 points into skills. Each can have a maximum of 5.
more than 5 skills for your character and distribute 35 points into your the general sk or more skills and link each with an attribute. Distribute 35 points into them with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 5 in each.
Distribute 44 points into the 8 attributes with a minimum of 2 and a maximum 9 in each. No more than one 8 or 9 and no more than two 7’s.
Items:
Roll 3d6 and divide by 2 to get item bonus for a new item.
The bonus on anything used as a weapon contributes to damage but not accuracy.
Magical foci like staves, wands, and crystal balls contribute to spell damage.
On armor this is the soak bonus.
On shields this is the shield’s soak and the shield’s health.
initiative system:
roll and record initiatives. play through a round. one standard, move, and minor action.
subtract 10 from all initiatives and play another round. 0 or less means no actions.
repeat till all have 0 or less. reroll initiatives for next round
stealthing into combat is +10 initiative for the round.
dodging/blocking/parrying uses 10 initiative
leveling up:
Attributes do not level up. Through role-playing you can get -1 to one and +2 to another.
Skills of level 0 cannot level up. Additional player-made skills of level 1 can be obtained through role-playing.
Skills level up when you have accumulated successes and failures equal to the skills level. Then successes and failures reset to zero.
stats:
health = stamina*2 + resolve
Mana = stamina + resolve*2
Melee 1h damage = (str+weapon)/3 + d6
Melee 2h damage = (str+weapon)/2 + d6
Ranged 1h damage = item + d6
Ranged 2h damage = launcher + d6
Magic damage = (int+focus)/3 + d6 + (d6 per charge)
initiative = (wits + dexterity)/2 + 1d6
blocking = shield + endurance vs 3d6. Shield has soak and hp for itself.
start at level 1 but give a bonus equal to int/2 if they are lower level than int/2
the 8 attributes:
1. Dexterity
2. Strength
3. Stamina
	4. Perception
	5. luck
	6. charisma
7. wits
	8. Intellect
9. resolve


dodge/acrobatics[dex] at dm discretion. 95% dodge easily achievable. Suggestions: explosions/guns=unavoidable, success=prone, not possible in more 5 armor.




Block[sta] uses your shield instead of its level. Shields give additional soak on a successful block.




Every turn you get a move action, mental action, and an action for each hand.




Focus magic. Normal magic. Adds a die to next magic attack this combat.
Unarmed[dex]..... Seems fine
Healing soaked by armor. Can be charged. Is normal magic.
Multitarget only on charged magic attacks.
